         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>For my Friend Mr. <hi>A. L.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received yours, deſiring my advice for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of your Brothers Letters. Truly Sir, I ſhould be very ungrateful to him, unkind to my ſelf, and injurious to others, if I ſhould diſſwade you from offering thoſe to the publick, which in the communication may be pleaſurable to all. Many of them being written to my ſelf, and the reſt (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to his correſpondents, tis poſſible that in ſome of them the freedom of his Pen, and Intereſt with the perſon to whom he writ, might in ſome places make his expreſſions not ſo compact, or ſo clear, as the critical Peruſer expects. But doubtleſs he knew what he writ at the time when he writ, but was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to circumſcribe his fancy, either to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, or the Readers tranſitory underſtanding: yet meeting with one indued with a reaſonable kindneſs and temper, he will find nothing but what may be interpreted without any Interpreters. I remember there were ſome other paſſages in ſome of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Tranſactions of that age wherein he writ: ſubjects too ſubtile for a private Pen, I wiſh them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expung'd then expos'd; for (beſides the danger of treading upon the heels of truth) there is State, that connexion between the ſecrets and acts of State, that we (as private perſons) cannot, ought not, to cenſure
<pb facs="tcp:115124:4"/>one, unleſſe we knew the other. There are ſo many neceſſary miſts caſt before our eyes, ſo many umbrages before the light, that it were more ſafe for us to draw our Curtains, and take a nap, then to ſearch about (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> with his Lanthorn and Candle) to find out truth.</p>
            <p>We are ſo partiall in our Intereſts and ſelf-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either of mind or body, or both, that moſtly we account thoſe things neither good, rationall nor commodious, which do not concur in all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with our intire judgement, or individuall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had leiſure to peruſe the whole Packet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſent them to the publick; but in earneſt, Sir, I cannot ſpare ſo much time from my Intruſtments. It is my deſire therefore that you will adviſe with ſuch friends as have an affection to his repute; and if they be of my acquaintance, tell them (as an incouragement to their expenſe of time) my opinion is (ſo farre as I retain the memory of them, and I believe the reſt are ſuitable) that they are very choice deſcants, Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Ethicall, facetious and ſolid. The volatile part ſhewing the art of the Chymiſt, as the fixt matter: there is ſomething to pleaſe all Tempers, maſculine and feminine, martial and civil, curiall and rurall, ſaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and amorous: and I doubt not but if he had lived the compleating of his Tranſlation of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> or <hi>Loves Maſter-piece,</hi> I know not whether he would have done greater right to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> by making <hi>French Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh French:</hi> the accompliſhments of his Pen therein were ſo clear and genuine, as if his private had conſulted with the publick Genius of both Nations: however, I dare ſay, by accuſtoming his
<pb facs="tcp:115124:4"/>Pen to theſe, and things of an higher nature, he would have proved an Engliſh <hi>Balzack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſſe I wiſh we were reſtated in our primitive Innocency, when all our actions were naked, and yet not aſhamed; and when our thoughts were imparted either by an univerſal Character, or the harmleſs Hieroglyphick of a Dove or a Lamb; but now how are we involved in the perplexities of our ſcribling! So that well may the word <hi>Litera</hi> be etymologiz'd <hi>Litis aera,</hi> the Epoche, or beginning of all contentions; we began modeſtly with the bark and rind of Trees, till the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ages having thus deſtroyd their ſhady Groves, tore the skins from harmleſſe ſheep, that their impure <hi>Volumes</hi> might be countenanc't by thoſe innocent <hi>Velumes;</hi> and not contented to deprive theſe creatures of their intire ſepultures, they have perverted their bodies to gluttony, and their skins to impoſtures; and the latter Age hath even robb'd the poor of their raggs, torturing them with Mills and other Engines, till in paper they are made Legatives to moſt of our humane affairs; and no ſooner are they fitted with the colour of innocency, white, but compounds of poiſons, Vitriol, Gall, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger (emblemes of commotion) do again die them with the ſad and ſable tincture, which occaſions ſo much diſorder and unquiet to the World.</p>
            <p>And now at laſt we ſeem diſtracted with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber &amp; weight of devices, ſo that an <hi>Index Expurgatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hath been practiſed by the learned, and more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed (without diſtinction) by the inrodes of the ignorant.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Seneca's</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Epiſtles have eſcap't, may <hi>Loveday</hi>'s have the ſame ſucceſſe and eſtimate; and
<pb facs="tcp:115124:5"/>then after-ages will not blame me for incouraging you to their expoſure, eſpecially if they pleaſe to read and imitate his leiſurable imployment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely add this (being diverted by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approaches) that I well knew your Brother vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, faithful, and diſcreetly induſtrious in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of body and mind.

And of theſe, no inducement more impreſſive nor effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly perſwaſive, then the incouragement of a perſon, whoſe judicious pen has ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered his abilities to the world: by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb facs="tcp:115124:7"/>him, without any other additional delineature, the maſter of a rich Fancy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally known to be not onely an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Profeſſor, but a conſtant Advancer of all humane and divine learning: ſingularly vers'd in both: and whoſe affectionate intimacy to this Author, as it highly obliged him in his life; ſo have his judicious lines conduced no leſs to the perpetuating of his memory after his death. This may appear in the very firſt Letter, which this perſon of honour was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to addreſs to me: wherein he has returned with a modeſt candor the opinion he retained touching this ingenious: Author whoſe blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs repute, and fair deportment in the whole progreſs of hislife, mannagement of his affections, and current of his actions ſuperſeded all cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The Author indeed, had a reſolution, if God had lent him life, and enlarged his houres in a parallel line to the apparent progreſſion of his raiſing hopes, "to have ſeen theſe, as they were by him occaſionally compoſed, ſo methodically diſpoſed and completed: and to beſtow a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting addition on his Pen, in ſuch manner poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refined, as they might have clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the precious quality of that Mine, and purity of his Mind from whence they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their extraction. As for his Pen, give me leave to return that opinion of it, which all
<pb facs="tcp:115124:7"/>men who with recollected thoughts have ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly read him, ingeniouſly retain'd of it: his <hi>Stile</hi> was ſuch as it knew how to preſent State without affectation; render a modeſt cenſure without bitterneſs, and cloſe the period of his Diſcourſe with incomparable ſweetneſſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were his <hi>parts</hi> onely deſerving, his <hi>educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>deſcent</hi> held an equipage to thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive imbelliſhments. To the ſurviving reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I ſhall give you this account; He was well deſcended, his education was in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where in his greeneſt years he did not ſhake off the yoak of diſcipline, and devote himſelf to the ſoft blandiſhments of ſenſuality, but was ſedulous to his ſtudy, and 'tis like had atchiev'd ſome ſuitable preferment, had not martial times occurr'd, no friend to Science, and diſturbed his ſtudies; this made him run the ſame fortune with others, who liv'd to ſtudy: were driven to ſtudy to live; for as that pure <hi>Italian</hi> Wit <hi>Petrarch</hi> ſometimes ſaid <q>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> his Armory, and <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Meniey, run ſo much upon <hi>diviſions,</hi> as they ſeldom cloze in a graceful harmony.</q> And thus his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were forced to a hait, but his active ſoul mov'd in the Sphere of Virtue, and in thoſe cloudy dayes was pregnant in ſomething that ſtill witneſſed that Virtue was his Miſtriſs, and many ingenious Pieces fell from his Pen, which hereafter may ſee the World, and deſerve thy
<pb facs="tcp:115124:8"/>peruſal (if clear Fancies may ſuit with the conſtitution of cloudy times.) He had acquir'd to himſelf the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Languages, out of the laſt his Verſion of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> which he call'd <hi>Hymen</hi>'s <hi>Praeludia,</hi> the firſt three Parts are extant, and gain'd applauſe: how his Letters will arride thy liking, I know not, do as thou ſhalt find them. So I take my leave, <hi>Farewel.</hi>

               <p>I Had not failed you laſt Week, if a ſudden command from thoſe whoſe breath can blow me any way, had not arreſted my pen, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a leſs pleaſing imployment; for there is no delight I can ſpare with more regret, then theſe occaſions of ſending you my naked thoughts, for Intereſt is now adored with ſuch ſpecious idolatry, that it renders even common converſe dangerous: So the honeſt ſoul that courts good company, muſt find it in his own thoughts; to the ſtock of which your amity contributes no petty ſum: and when the vacancy of imployment relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes me to theſe harmleſs recreations, I endeavour to drop thoſe heavy-moulded cares that ſmell of earth, and fall a pruning the wings of ſome live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts; that play like nimble flies in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of an unclouded mind; and amidſt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of thoſe tasks I impoſe upon them, the principal are diſpatch'd to invite Content to come and dwell in the Valley of my humble Fortunes, and ſport it ſelf upon thoſe banks that are happily purpled with their own vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. Protected thus with a little, methinks I am proud that I have not enough to ſet the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115124:11"/>a deſiring, nor the Ambitious a ſcrambling. Sometime I ſtrive to build Reaſon as high a Tribunal as my thoughts can reare, at the Bar of which I labour to accuſe my own miſcarriages; and had I power to reform, as well as cenſure them, what could affront my felicity? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I reviſe my readings in men, and fall a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the beſt Slips my obſervation can cull from others Gardens; but I confeſs few of them grow. Sometimes I prick at the footſteps that books have lately left in my memory; which I find a very weak Conſervatory, and keeps my beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations but as people uſe to keep choice Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, freſh for a day or two, and then let them fade and die. Then perhaps I roll my thoughts upon Eternity, and that helps me to deride the folly of thoſe blind Wretches that ſo hotly ſcramble for ſublunary trifles; but withall, pity their miſerable miſtake that run away from the true bleſſings while they purſue the falſe ones. Tis ſport to conſider how Fortune (or rather Providence) builds up theſe creatures (like Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds for a ſhow) with an intent to pull them down again. Sometimes I am ſo weak to let my fancie ramble after Poetick raptures; but in theſe I onely ſuffer her to aire her wings, and ſo come home again. With theſe agreeable diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I often ſend my thoughts a gadding, chiefly to deceive melancholy, which of late has been much incroaching; for my capital trouble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115124:11"/>and has got a giddineſs to aſſiſt it. I have not yet taken the Phyſick, and now reſolve to defer it till I arrive in the Countrey, which will be about a fortnight hence. If theſe afflictions can ſet me the right way to Heaven, eſpecially as it is now perplexed with ſo many oblique, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious pathes of Error and Hereſie, I ſhall hug them heartily.

               <p>THIS happy night I received your laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which how I took, I wiſh ſome good thing above Man would tell you, for I cannot. Onely this, the delights and joyes which are dandled by the World were baſe and droſſie to what that brought me, which is onely leſs pure then thoſe that make the Angels clap their wings. It has given me a happy, but a hard task; Tis to let an Ocean through a Quill, for tis the ſame difficulty for my Pen to expreſs what my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115124:12"/>heart meanes you. Methinks I would faine ſay ſomething to you that is not ordinary; but I can find no words that I do not ſuſpect too faint to fit my affection: onely this, I do not love you the common way, nor with ſuch a kindneſſe as doth uſually blaze with the freſh reſentment of a benefit, and learne to coole and dye again, unleſſe it be renew'd with the ſame repeated fuell: but I have an affection for you that is of the ſame piece with my ſoul, as immortall and undecaying as it ſelf, and will go along with it to the other world, and need not be aſham'd even there to own its object. The buſie waves that roll betwixt us cannot keep me from you; for tis with you I ſpend my gladdeſt hours. When I ſet my thoughts to caſt up the account of my large poſſeſſions in you, I deride the poor rich ones of this Age, and ſay, Sure if they knew the right way they would leave the purſuit of their glorious follies, &amp; learne to get a virtuous friend. But pardon my tranſport. Preſent me cordially to your excellent friend; and intreat him to write me in the number of his faithfull ſervants, for I cannot be leſſe to him that is ſo to you: tell him I will allow him the better roome in your breaſt, ſo he not grudge me a harbour there; to be expel'd which, would gall my heart-ſtrings. No perplexities aſſault it but what you help to beat off; no vexations pierce it to which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon my intereſt in you does not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115124:12"/>prove a <hi>Dictamnum,</hi> and ejects thoſe arrowes be ſure then you be precious to your ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard your health, that you may ſtil be ſo to thoſe that love you; and then you muſt be ſo. But I fear I grow tedious, though I have not ſpoke halfe what I would fain ſay; but the reſt ſhall be refer'd to my next. Well then, conceive I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you at this diſtance, for all but my clay does. May you arrive at ſo happy a condition that you may pitty your enemies, and enjoy that ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſoul that may make you ſo skilfull in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and be aſſured, that bate but heaven, &amp; there is nothing ſo dear as your ſelf to him that is</p>

               <p>I Had long ſince payed the debt of my promiſe, had Fame furniſhed me with ought but falſe coine: ſhe is growne a new-faſhion'd jugler, puts tricks upon us with a <hi>deceptio auditus,</hi> various reports here like Canons receive their birth and funerall in the aire, and are often ſhorter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd; ſome voyc'd like Trumpets ſpread a ſhrill preſage of war; others, like the ſoft war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the amorous Lute, perfume the aire with the aromatick tidings of repeated peace: and thus our erroneous ſoules weakly pay a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous homage to the alternate dominion of our own hopes and feares. Rumour is a cheating lottery, from which for one prize of a truth we draw a thouſand blanks of falſhood I could make this paper look big with the ſwelling pride of ſuch newes as would be muſick to your eares; but leſt the tune ſhould prove Syrenicall, I am loth to deceive you into falſe joyes. That which has moſt credit with me, except the K. &amp;c.— Thus I have given you probabillties, befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not defended, by the moſt prudent opinions I could encounter with. Could I give you the truth ſtrip'd of all partiality and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, ſhe were worth the owning; but her run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115124:14"/>through ſo many relations makes her change attire every ſtep, and ſometimes loſe her ſelf. But in this aſſertion be aſſur'd ſhe weares her own face, without a mask, that I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I Am now about to change the Scene; and I fear it will be a long time before I ſhall date my Letters again from <hi>London,</hi> a place I once eſteem'd above all the earth could ſhow me; but my liking is almoſt drown'd in thoſe ſcarlet ſtreames have lately ſtain'd it. I may now be ſaid to be retiring from a crowd to an hermitage: for (though tis like I ſhall mingle with much people) I ſhall notwithſtanding be alone; ſince tis not the eye, but the mind and the affections that create ſociety; like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> that ſtood up to the mouth in water, yet could not drink. But the armes of amity are long enough to reach a true friend at the greateſt diſtance; for though there be a larger piece of earth get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between our heavier parts, yet thoſe that have the ſtamp of immortality need confeſſe no other limits than what bound the Univerſe. Thus
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115124:14"/>ſometimes my pen, ſometimes my thoughts ſhal viſit you, and fancy an intertainment ſuitable to the love that carries them. If Nature had not planted a mutuall affection in our greeneſt yeares, and taught it to ſwim (like a fiſh in its proper Element) in the Crimſon ſap we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd from the ſame fruitfull ſtock, I think I ſhould have bidden fair for your friendſhip with much induſtry, and, like a ſlip that fetch'd his Pedigree from ſome excellent root, ſet it with much diligence in my triangular Garden. But no more. As I was reviſing ſome ſcriblings, with an intent to pack each in his proper place before my parting, I lighted on theſe Rhymes, made about the time I firſt put on chaines, &amp; upon that ſubject. I had thrown them by with ſuch a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as I uſe when I treat with ſuch trifles, that when I re-met with them they had been ſo loſt to my memory, that they prov'd as new to my ſelf as they will be to you. I do not ſend them with a thought they deſerve your reading, but onely to let you ſee that when I am weary of better imployment, I have not forgot to dally with the Pinkes in <hi>Apollo's</hi> Garden. I wiſh all accidents, events, humors, and diſpoſitions may conſpire to make this your meeting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightfull. If my fancy could carry my earthy part as nimbly as her ſelfe, I think I ſhould help to feather ſome glad houres among you. But tis not wiſdome to deſire what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115124:15"/>have. You ſee I have much adoe to keep within the bounds of my paper. Farewell dear brother, and continue to love</p>

               <p>I Was alwaies loth to ſuffer breach of word to keep company with the reſt of my crimes, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable neceſſity did not force the guilt. And indeed we ſhould hate falſe promiſes for his ſake that firſt hatch'd them; deceit of this kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap'd mans primitive innocence, and made him leave that large Legacy of imperfection to his unhappy heires. But to ſwell this to the uſuall ſtature of my tedious Letters, I muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe Citizens of the world called younger brothers, that are oft forc'd to range far from home to inlarge their narrow fortunes. And ſince I have caſually chop'd upon this Simile, I think the relation of this kind may prove leſſe unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, than the word, I ſhould otherwiſe deſigne to black this Paper. It is the Story of the great Cardinal <hi>Mazarini,</hi> that ſits now at the ſtern of the <hi>French</hi> affairs. He is by birth a <hi>Scicilian,</hi> by extraction ſcarce a Gentleman; his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115124:16"/>education ſo mean as might have wrote man before he could write: but being in Natures debt for a handſome face, a ſtout heart, and a ſtirring ſpirit, he no ſooner knew that <hi>Scicily</hi> was not all the World, but his active thoughts were got above his poor condition, and made him reſolve to dwell no longer with his domeſtick penury: and now being come into <hi>Italy,</hi> his good fortune conducted him to the caſual encounter of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Knight, to whoſe ſervice his debonair behaviour ſoon preferr'd him. This <hi>German</hi> was well skill'd in the vices of his Nation, which he committed with ſuch cunning as (though he drank and playd very deep) yet his skill in the one main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his debauch in the other. This was a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the yong <hi>Scicilian</hi> deem'd worth his learning; and having curiouſly obſerv'd how his Maſter ſhak'd his Elbow, began to practiſe his Art upon his own Companions; in which he thrived ſo well, as daily improving his skill with his ſtock, he began to foſter forward hopes, which were well befriended by ſome affaires that called his Maſter to <hi>Rome;</hi> where taking occaſion to ſtep into better company, and ſtill following his faculty at play, it was not long before he had hoarded a thouſand Crowns; then good Luck (the Dam of Ambition) began to hatch ſome aſpiring thoughts, which firſt ſhewed themſelves in a requeſt to his Maſter, thus; ſince Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115124:17"/>had lately thought fit to mend his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, he would vouchſafe to do as much to his condition, and to entertain him in the quality of a Gentleman; to deſerve which he promiſed to maintain himſelf proportionably, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any addition to his allowance. This granted, he preſently commences Gallant, and begins to practiſe ſuch generous qualities as are uſually paid with reputation and profit: his good clothes and complete ſhape firſt admitted him, and his pleaſant converſation indeared him to the beſt ſociety, and ſtill his play ſupported him in it. At length his Maſter takes his leave of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore he of his Maſter; telling him that he could not forſake that place which he hoped was cut out to be the forge of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and being now grown intimate with ſome Gentlemen that attended the Cardinal who ſteer'd the helm of the Papal Intereſt, he found means to be made known unto him, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ſervice, with a behaviour ſo handſomly compoſed, as at the ſame time it got him both admiſſion and affection. The Cardinal, after ſome tryal of his temper and peruſal of his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was well pleaſed with the diſcovery of a piercing wit, woven with a cleer judgment and an active Genius, with a capacity apt to receive ſuch impreſſions as are not uſually ſtamp'd in every brain; he was alwayes very careful to fill up thoſe intervals which his buſineſſe and play
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115124:17"/>had left vacant, with ſtudy of State-affaires; in which he proſpered with ſo much felicity, that after his Cardinal had worn him a year or two at his ear, and diſtilled his State-Maximes into his fertile ſoul, he thought fit to breathe the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he had given him in ſome action that might let the World take notice of his pregnant abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: he was therefore ſent Coadjutor to a Nuntio who was then diſpached to one of the Princes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and during that imployment he injoyned his Creature to give him a Weekly account of their tranſactions; which he did with ſo much vivacity of apprehenſion and gravity of judgment, that the Cardinal began to couple admiration with affection; and (as if Fate had combined with Nature and Fortune to advance him) the Nuntio's ſudden death lets fall the whole weight of the buſineſs upon his ſhoulders, which he ſupported with ſuch a ſtrength of ſoul, managed with ſuch dexterous ſolidity, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for all to his Cardinal with ſuch a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning induſtry, as he wrought it with his Holineſs to declare him Nuntio. And now as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment had made him more conſpicuous, ſo his brave heart uſed the advantage of that new height to diſtribute longer rayes with a more lively luſtre. But to contract the Story; his Commiſſion expired, and the affaires that begot it happily concluded, he returns to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he receives (beſides a general grand repute) the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115124:18"/>dear careſſes of his Cardinal, and the plauſive benedictions of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor. About this time the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> had gotten ſo much glory by making his Maſter <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. of a weak man a mighty Prince, as he grew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to all Chriſtendom, and contracted ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition and envy from <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: this made the ſtanding Conclave to reſolve upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch of ſome able inſtrument, to countermine his dangerous, and give a check to the carriere of his prodigious ſucceſſes. This reſolved, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concurr'd in the choice of <hi>Mazarini,</hi> as the fitteſt head-piece to give their fears death in the others deſtruction. To fit him for this great imployment, the Pope gives him a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat, and ſends him into <hi>France</hi> with a large Legantine Commiſſion; where being arrived, and (like his politick ſelf) firſt complying with that grand Fox, the better to get a Clue to his Labyrinth, began to ſcrew himſelf into Intelligence; but when he came to ſound his plots, and perceive he could find no bottom, he began to look from the top of his enterpriſe as people do from Precipices, with a frighted eye; and now finding the deſign not onely not feaſible, but very dangerous, (the other never uſing to take a leſſe vengeance then ruine for ſuch darings) and then conſidering that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to <hi>Rome</hi> would neither be honorable nor ſafe, without attempting ſomething: he at laſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115124:18"/>reſolves to declare himſelf <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Creature, and (to win the more confidence) unrips the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of all <hi>Romes</hi> deſigns againſt him. This made the other take him to his breaſt, acquainted him with the ſecret contrivance of all his <hi>Dedalian</hi> policies, and when he left the World declared him his Succeſſor; and he is now the great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal that umpires (almoſt all Chriſtendom,) and now ſhines in the <hi>Gallique</hi> Court with ſo proud a pomp. But I have made my Story too wordiſh; if time would have conſented, I think I ſhould have pared much of that away which you will find ſuperfluous: but take this rude haſty draught for the preſent, and expect the next to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poliſhed by</p>

               <p>IF imployment from them (to whom my thin fortunes have made obedience a debt) had not countermanded my intents, my Pen had not held its peace laſt week, nor I been forced to ſet an excuſe on the forehead of this. Your pleaſing reliſh of my laſt mindes me of ſuch Palates as prefer ſome courſe diſh they love well, before exquiſite dainties; thus has affection taught your opinion (like the Philoſophers Stone) to turn my viler metal into gold. But enough of this, leſt Modeſty ſhould appear Deſign, and I ſeem of that number that would improve their praiſes by rejecting them, and (like cunning Merchants) ſend their goods away that they may return with increaſe. Indeed I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my diſpoſition, and wrong my deſires, if I confeſt not that they are levelled at the good opinion of all; but moſt my affection, if I ſhould not ſay it chiefly aimed at yours. For from the object at which Love ſhoots moſt Ardour, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the ſame Rayes is, moſt paſſionately deſired; but though I can let theſe into my ſoul with much delight, yet the inward reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my feeble deſerts muſt not ſuffer them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115124:20"/>to kindle the tickling vanity of ſelf-love. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is the Mother of all beautiful actions; it is the Taper that leads the way to all that is called Deſert; where that is miſpriſed, vertue is benumm'd, and Reaſon it ſelf falls aſleep: but it is not lawfully gained by ſuch merits as make a noiſe on purpoſe to be heard; they bid faireſt for it that manage a baſhful skill, and (as I have ſeen you cut faces on a Cherry-ſtone) ſhew much artifice in a narrow Continent, that will not brag of a broad appearance. The commodities you exchange for my trifles, have a better eſtimation here then with you; for I muſt tell you my heart thrives by this pleaſing traffick, and grows rich with true delight. I am now taking the Phyſick the Doctor ſent me (for our journey is ſtill delaied;) of the operation I ſhall put my account in the next.

I am now at <hi>Nottingham</hi> perfectly ſetled with my Lord <hi>C.</hi> My imployment is ſomething too great for an unſeaſoned ſervant, and would diſcourage a new beginner, if I did not ſupply the defects of my experience with an active pliant reſolution. I attend him in his chamber, and uſher his Lady, write his Letters, and whatever elſe that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems not his command or my obedience. My wages are little enough to make preſent ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance circumſcribe my gains: but I think I have already a greater allowance of his love then his money; however, I ſhall make the leaſt ſerve to keep me afloat without the aſſiſtance of my own bladders. And now ſince the careleſs hand of Fortune has ranged me with ſtrangers that I have not yet begun to read over, I can value it at no lower rate then my beſt recreation to give you the exact ſtory of my actions and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by piece-meal, as I tear it from my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn time; which jewel I have uſed too long

Thus having raiſed the price of my minutes, I begin ſharply to cenſure the ſlight of your proffered aid in the knowledge of Simples, for I think I ſhall bend my ſtudies that way. I have he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſome of my later houres on the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which I have already half gained, and fear not to bring my attempts to a ſudden perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it being familiarly ſpoken by the beſt ſort of this family.

By that time the Spring will have

I intend to cloſe this Springs courſe with open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Iſſue in my Arme on the contrary ſide by way of revulſion. Did but my health ſmile upon my deſignes, you ſhould ſoon view my imployment in a fairer Character: Till then my ſoul muſt write with a bad pen upon blotted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and you know how ill tooles will ſhame the Artificer.

                  <p>My laſt two Letters vext you with the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſcription of my malady; and this has charge to tell you, that I hope I ſhall give you no more ſuch penances; The cure of it being now undertaken by a man in this Countrey, whoſe fortunate skill has triumph'd over ſtrange Diſeaſes; which has got him the acclamations of his patients, and the envy of his own tribe. His ſtory is this; he was born well (being the great Dr. <hi>B's</hi> Nephew, moſt of whoſe receipts he has;) but bred meanly, firſt bound Prentice to a Shoomaker in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> from whom he ran away moſt ingeniouſly, and return'd ſome years after a profeſt Phyſitian: how far he fetch'd his Art, or whether moſt beholding for it to bookes or men, I know not, (and in it himſelf is reſolutely ſilent;) but almoſt miraculous ſucceſſe in the Calling made him quickly known and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. Preſently after theſe ſad times burſt forth, in which it was his fortune to ſide with the weaker party. There are many (not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome) ſtories told of his behaviour while the ſword was unſheath'd; among the reſt this,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115124:29"/>which I had from his own mouth. He having command in a Garriſon neer, did often give ſome ungentle viſits to his Townſmen at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> and was for almoſt a year (though a Phyſitian) their continuall Ague; at length in a skirmiſh neer <hi>Darby</hi> it was his fortune to be made Priſoner, and thence was ſtraitly guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded towards <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where they intended to give him no worſe reward than a hanging for his former courteſies. By the way he invites his Conductors (being ſixteen Troupers) to a Crowns-worth of Ale, which he privately ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd with ſuch a ſoveraigne ingredient, that it ſuddenly caſt them all in a profound ſleep; which done, he at pleaſure rifles their pockets, and takes from them about 200. <abbr>

                     </abbr> and returnes merrily to his own Garriſon. Since the war his fame is growne much louder, and his ſteps where ere he goes waited on by multitudes. I cannot heare that he undertakes any in whoſe cure he failes; he refuſes to look on Urines, and onely obſerves the wriſt when the right hand is grip'd, never failing to diſcover the nature, cauſe and ſeat of the malady, which he undertakes or rejects, as he finds it either feaſable or deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. I am now his Patient; and though I yet can brag of little amendment by what I have taken, yet his confidence bids me hope well: he has let
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115124:30"/>me blood under the Tongue, and cut a veine in my eare aſunder; and I am now taking of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Electuaries and Purges. The charge I find will be very great, but I am reſolv'd to buy off this plague at any rate, though I pinch for it all my life after.</p>
                  <p>I lately receiv'd a Letter from my dear Mr. <hi>W.</hi> then at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which becauſe it gives a hopefull dawning of ſome tranſmarine imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have ſent you the Copy of it, and (to ſilence other likelihoods) I ſuppoſe this winter will determinate my ſtay in this family; but before that time I doubt not to exchange many ſuch as theſe with you.

               <p>I Cannot ſtep ſo far out of the way, as not to find out a path to you; diſtance having onely power to render me remote to my friend in my circumſcriptive part, while the unconfined, without toyling with the method of motion, or paſſing through a ſucceſſion of places, can be with you in a moment: and indeed we carry that about us that confutes the cuſtom of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels with wings, when we conſider how ſuddenly our thoughts are charioted (without the penetration of a medium) to the fartheſt parts of the World, by the help of that faculty which doubtleſſe is neer akin to their Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal natures; ſince though a wing be the nimbleſt inſtrument of motion, yet it confeſſes an order of it, which thoſe Divine Intelligences are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115124:33"/>task'd to. But why theſe Metaphyſicks in a Letter? will be your ſecret objection; to which I have not roome enough to give any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than that I had rather ſay nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than nothing at all. We are now in a Town where moſt of the people get their bread by their water, I meane the Bath; and thoſe that never knew how to governe themſelves, are yet guides to others: of a City tis doubtleſs the prettieſt of <hi>England,</hi> in a double conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is little, and handſome. I have been ſomething curious to inform my ſelf of its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; but the beſt account I could get does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford but poore ſatisfaction: the ſobereſt have onely told me my own Conjectures, that the irruption of theſe hot Springs, which certainly borrow their warmth in their paſſage through a ſulphurous minerall, was the cauſe of building this City; but in the conveyance of particulars to poſterity, as the time, founders, with other circumſtances, Tradition has been very unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in ſuffering the truth to be ſwallow'd by a fable which goes very currant among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and talkes of a King call'd <hi>Bladud,</hi> that being a great Necromancer (I know not for what reaſon) caus'd by the power of his Art theſe waters to be boil'd under-ground into ſuch an immenſe quantity, as hath ſerv'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boile all thoſe that have ſince reſorted hither to waſh off their Diſeaſes. I have had but little
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115124:34"/>time to try the virtue of it, being forc'd to waite upon my Lords humour of peruſing all the Townes and Houſes of remarke round about it; yet I have been already in it five times, and ſound ſo little virtue in thoſe ſteepings, as though I have us'd the hot Pumpe, according to Dr. <hi>B's.</hi> preſcriptions, for my head, yet I find it has rather done me harme than good, and halfe diſcourag'd my further triall. I find my ſelf daily more ſubject to your Splenitive malady, which ſince I us'd the Bath has made it ſelf known to me with more than an uſuall vigour: Beſides, I think I have gotten the Stone to boot. If all theſe produce but the fruits of a Divine Correction, I may think my ſelfe happy in my ſufferings. In my peruſall of the Cathedrall here (a ſtructure that is rather hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than magnificent, and claimes as little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration as contempt) I met with an old Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the wall, which at firſt ſtartled me; the words were theſe:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The Trees going to chooſe their King,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But upon inquiry I learn'd from a perſon that had read the ancient Records, this Inſcription was made in Honour of one <hi>Oliver King,</hi> Abbot of a Monaſtery, that laid the foundation of this Minſter; the <hi>Rebus</hi> is alluſive to a paſſage in <hi>Judges,</hi> where the Trees convented to chooſe them a King, and pitch'd firſt upon the Olive,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115124:34"/>though at laſt the Bramble carried it. So this pittifull piece of wit was ſet up as a gratefull memoriall of that Abbot's piety.</p>

               <p>I Remember your frequent ſolicites gain'd a promiſe from me to compoſe you a Prayer; for which though the ſenſe of my own inſufficiency might juſtly dig a grave in oblivion, yet I have rather choſe to deſerve a cenſure for the bad performance, than the totall forfeiture. Prayer is the Golden Chaine that tyes Heaven and Earth together; it is the pure Elementall flame whoſe property is to aſcend upwards, with which the ſoul, like the Phoenix, ſets her neſt afire, and even expires in the midſt of all thoſe kindled odours; it is a key that opens Heavens gates, and

It is the chief weapon us'd in our ſpirituall warfare; nor do we ſtand to't ſo ſtifly in any combate with our common enemy, as when humble Devotion and tender Zeal makes us ſhorter by the whole length of the legs. Thus we aſcend by ſtooping; thus we conquer by ſubmiſſion. Tis the beſt Phyſick for a ſickly ſoul, and penitent teares a ſoveraigne diet-drink for a diſeas'd conſcience. But you alwaies lov'd it too well to need an incouragement from my weak deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet becauſe I know you are not apt to take any advice ill that flowes from ſo true an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as mine, I will venture to give you theſe few ſhort obſervations before you enter upon this duty; Allow your ſelf ſome time to conſider the importance of this weighty affaire, and try to fly as high in apprehenſion of the Divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, majeſty, mercy, &amp;c. as the weak wings of your contemplation will ſuffer you; theſe thoughts will furniſh: you with ſuch awe and reverence as is requiſite in ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and help you to ſhut out all vaine and idle imaginations that eſpecially at thoſe times flock to the diſturbance of Devotion. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet not to ſtay long upon the duty till Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faints, and your fervour cooles: I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tis a more hainous ſin than the miſtaken
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115124:35"/>world is aware of, to bring a cold careleſſe heart to theſe duties; and as I muſt condemne thoſe that dare approch the Divinity with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſtuffe as their proud ignorance huddles up in extemporall haſte, ſo I do not commend them that onely tye their Tongues to one prayer, and think that no words can find the way to Heaven but thoſe they got by heart in their childhood. Variety is the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and why the ſoul may not not fancy a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pleaſure in often appearing to her God in the change of devour rayment, I know not: Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary uſe changes even the moſt troubleſome imployment into delight. Oh could we bring Divine affaires to that happy habit, how much of Heaven ſhould we taſt even on Earth!</p>

               <p>VVHen my thoughts tell me that ſucceſſe does not alwaies ſuit with a rationall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and future events often falſifie the promiſes of a preſent appearance, I am forc'd to feed ſuch incertainties (in reference to your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115124:36"/>malady) as uſually flow from the doubtfull combate betwixt Hope and Feare, wherein Love diſcharges both the active and paſſive part. From this you may judge how glad I would be that the newes of your perfect recovery would make peace between them; which pray, as you value my quiet, keep no longer from my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There is a tenderneſſe that waites upon unvarniſh'd amity, which perhaps of ſome Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſoules will get no other Title than imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and yet methinks here we cannot love wel without it; for though it be not a part, at leaſt it is a fruit of friendſhip, and as requiſite as ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and delicacy in a feminine Compoſure; For if I muſt go with my friends halfe in all his joyes and griefs, I cannot give better proof that I have my ſtake in the latter, than by ſuch an Evidence. Give me leave then to tell you, that at preſent you cannot do me a greater Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie (if health hath impowr'd you) than to cure me of thoſe troubles that are the off-ſpring of yours. When I found my Lords danger ſo hopefully over-blown, I wiſh'd my ſelf againe at <hi>Holt,</hi> and half fell out with my Condition, that at the ſame time called me ſeverall waies by the name of Servant and Brother. Yet I did not carry away all my ſelfe at our parting; for, believe it, my better part has hover'd conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about you, and you had the unſeen aſſiſtance of my earneſt addreſſes to the beſt Phyſitian.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115124:36"/>But tis more than time to conſider I am tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; let me once more conjure you to give no advantage to your Diſeaſe by any inward diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; and continue to love him who will live and dye, dear Brother, unchangeably</p>

               <p>THe doubt that my firſt Letter might miſſe the way to your hands has made me venture to ſend you this ſecond trouble, conceiving it a leſſe ſin to be too obſequious than neglectfull: and indeed your kindneſſe would win the name
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115124:37"/>of Charity in vouchſafing a mutuall corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence: for though I be very civilly us'd from the very top to the toe of this whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, yet in this throng I am forc'd to find out ſolitude; none here being made of better clay than will render them fit veſſells for houſhold-affaires; and I confeſſe I would be glad to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take other qualities in him I faſten on with a ſtronger tye than the ordinary ſlipping knots of faint acquaintance. This makes me oft put my ſelf to the paine of thinking how much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe I loſt at a clap by being pluck'd from your ſociety; and theſe thoughts leave me a kind of a Carkaſſe till my ſoule comes home againe, which (if it were viſible) you might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee buſily hovering about your ſelfe, ſtill panting after thoſe delights which, alas! ſhe has loſt in her divorce from you; but it is in your power to reſtore me part of them. I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no newes, leſt I weary you with the relation of what you know. I muſt onely ſay, this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious victory of late has much leſſened my infidelity concerning your judicious opinion of future events; &amp; there wants but the unmaſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Parties reſolutions to make me their perfect convert.

               <p>I Am never unfurniſh'd of a double welcome for your Letters; the firſt, as they come from your perſon, the other from your Pen; as they are cordially meant, and skilfully writ: and thus both my love and liking are your Priſoners, and have long ſince rejected the liberty of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as the harder bondage of the two. That which we call happineſſe (I meane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to ſublunaries) is ſomething proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch deſires as are uppermoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indefinite, becauſe it alwaies takes a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhape from every ſngle inclination; all aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at, though few or none hitting, that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good, Contentment. One hunts his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in riches, another climbes for it by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, a third thinks it ſwims upon the top of voluptuary fruition, the fourth places it in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115124:38"/>and in fine, ſo long as mankind dwells on this ſide of the Moon, every one carries his witch about him. For my part, a true friend is my <hi>Indies;</hi> and I reliſh more felicity in being well thought of by a virtuous perſon, than in enjoying all that the others court with ſo much eagerneſſe and ardour: And I hugge this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with more indulgence, becauſe paſſions of this nature are ever friends with Reaſon, and give no bluſh in their Colours. And thus I have given you my heart tranſcrib'd. It poſes me to expreſſe my gladneſſe for the faire hopes of my Siſter <hi>J's.</hi> recovery; but the height of it might have been taken in my feares of meeting ill newes, which made me ſo much a Coward as I could hardly forbeare ſhaking when I opened your Letter: I pray ſpeake me to her in the beſt Language of affection, and tell her I hardly endured the cruelty of my occaſions, that would not let me ſee her in her danger. This Problematicall feaver has ſwept many of my acquaintance away in theſe parts: Death never gave ſhorter warning of his approch; therefore we had need ſtand upon a carefull guard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that when he arreſts he may not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.

               <p>JUſtice enjoynes my confeſſion that you have made me amends for your ſilence, and pai'd me my Arrears in groſſe which I expected in particulars; for though your Letters cannot come often enough to leſſen their welcome, yet you know rarity heightens the price of things, and winds up the delight to a taller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than when it goes and comes in a leſſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at ſeverall parcells. Conclude not from this that I deſire you ſhould write but ſeldome; for believe it, I never had recreation nor buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that out-priz'd the pleaſant care I alwaies took to keep our quills in play, and thus to prune the feathers, and ſtir the pinions of our amity. Let not the conceit of an Hectick get any credit with you; for tis the cuſtome of theſe Diſeaſes to lye long a gaſping before they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115124:40"/>dye, and like Candles new burnt out leave ſome heat in the ſocket: But I hope in a ſhort time to ſee your feares over-blown by a perfectreſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and now you will taſte your health with ſuch a reliſh as half-ſtarv'd men do Feaſts, or the hopeleſſe inhabitant of a Dungeon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected liberty. But (which deſerves both my praiſe and imitation) I am much taken with the grateful uſe you have made of Heavens bounty in relation to your deliverance; for ſince the largeſt heart is too narrow to ſet a juſt value upon ſuch favours, ſure thoſe that devoutly endeavour to bid the beſt price are beſt accepted. There are many requiſites in Chriſtianity, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe does ſweetly ſet us the way to the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but thanksgiving (when currantly pai'd) does even place us in the very ſuburbs of Heaven; by it we onely take out that leſſon here whoſe repetition will be both our buſineſſe and happineſſe to all Eternity. Laſt night with yours I received thoſe rude Draughts which you had from my unskilfull hand; but (rude as they are) they are like to do me ſervice in my preſent undertaking. Wiſe men tell us (Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion unconcern'd) tis weakneſſe to repent thoſe ingagements which we cannot retract with a ſafe reputation: elſe I would tell you, that if my bargaine were now to make, my Letters ſhould ſtill have ſlept in your hands, and perhaps I ſhould never have wak'd that danger
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115124:40"/>that now threatens my credit with the ſtings of ſome juſt Criticiſmes; but the die is caſt (and what ever I loſe by it) I am reſolv'd to play out the game. I came juſt now from Sir <hi>J. P.</hi> who ask'd very kindly for you; he lookes with a kind aſpect upon me; and if my hopes deceive me not in ſome Courteſies he has power to do me, I may chance to paſſe by all the great ones that know me, and direct my Dedication to him. But of this more when I know further. I hope it will prove no taske to perſwade you that I ſhall be perfectly glad to ſee you here in <hi>London;</hi> and indeed, if your intereſt where you are be not more conſiderable than your pen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, I can think it no better than a block to your preferment. In the meane time, while I am here, if I have a capacity to ſerve you, you cannot diſoblige me more than to be ſparing of your Commands. I have not, nor never will have any thing that is not yours; nay, my ſelf is not mine own if you have need of me; and though theſe words be not neceſſary to perſwade what you formerly believ'd, yet repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions in Love are onely not abſurd. Major <hi>W.</hi> returnes you his moſt affectionate reſpects; we never meet (which is very often) without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating your remembrance and health.

               <p>I Need not tell you I am now in <hi>Lincolneſhire,</hi> for I ſuppoſe you will eaſily read it in my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall intermiſſion. Thus to be out of the way is to be remote; ſince now the motion of our Letters muſt be more than ſemicircular, and they travell as people do in <hi>Wales,</hi> round about the hill, becauſe they cannot croſſe it in Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When I parted with the Major at <hi>London,</hi> I confeſſe I engaged to give you and him a meeting at <hi>Holt;</hi> but ſince our arrivall here it has pleas'd God to ſtrike my Lord and Lady, one with a fever, the other with a Tertian Ague, which in all probability wil reſolve into the New Diſeaſe; which extremely rages in theſe parts, and murders abundance of people: my Lord of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> onely Brother dyed of it laſt week. This enforces a ſuſpenſion of my purpoſe, and bids me content my ſelf to ſend you my imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at this diſtance.</p>
               <p>In this ſame voyage to the Grave, which we call Life, our condition is ſo fraile and floating, as we are nought elſe but living lumps of incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and irreſolution; ſo eaſie it is for Fortune
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115124:43"/>(or rather Providence) to unravel our ſtrongeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven deſignes, and unhinge our moſt ſerious intentions; that like the withered leaves of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, we are the game of every blaſt, and our health the prey of every ſickly vapour. But now Dear Brother how do you? have you yet ſcap't the fangs of this new-ſpawn'd malady? Pray tender your health very carefully: for my part, I ſhould deem my ſelf in great danger in this ſtanding-pool of Aire where we live, if the hole in my arm were not my friend, in giving ſeveral paſſeports to infection and contagious vapours, which ſo long as nature has power to thruſt out at that Sally-port, my danger is not great. I pray let me know if my ſiſter <hi>Janes</hi> health be yet perfected, and how thereſt of my friends hold out againſt the batteries of a putrified Climate. Preſent me, as is due, to all that know me; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me in your Affections, Wiſhes and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and believe it, your happineſs ſhall be always mentioned in his addreſſes to heaven that is, Dear Brother,</p>

               <p>YOu have ſubdued me ſo entirely, and tied the knot ſo ſtrait that binds me to you, that there is as much impoſſibility to undo it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to cut it: ſo as, like the miſtaken hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man that tills an unfruitful Soil, you muſt expect to receive a lean crop, not becauſe the earth is unthankful, but unable. After I had ſent my laſt, I received one of your Letters that plaid the Truant by the way, with ſome pieces of the broken Glaſs, which appeared like the disjoyned ſtaves of a wrackt Veſſel thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore by the Tide; the Pills came ſafe, which I ſince took at twice (loth to take proofs of ſo much kindneſs, as ſinners do the gifts of heaven, not to uſe them, but abuſe them.) You give me more hope then I dare accept, in reference to that check to all the delight I can either taſte or fancie, bating ſome divine Idea's, that by a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative transfiguring my deſires lift me above all thoſe inconſiderable toyes that the World ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges under the ſmiles and frowns of Fortune: but from thence, alas, the weight of my own weakneſs weighs me down again, and I return (like an inconvertible thief) to the ſame Priſon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115124:44"/>from whence puniſhment ſo lately freed me. But we cannot be more then men, till we be ſtript of our clay, and put on ſomething in its ſtead that poſes our apprehenſions, and is beſt deſcribed by negatives.</p>
               <p>I muſt make one among the admirers of your excellent fancy, that could retain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a face that time might have wiped out without an almoſt juſt treſpaſs of memory: but you were born to theſe advantages, and do but methodically imbelliſh thoſe qualities in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and ſingular performances that nature gave you in lump and ſubſtance. The old woman my laſt mentioned is with much ado gotten over the threſhold of the other World, and has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed her Corps to a <hi>Nottingham</hi>-Grave; whither I believe we ſhall wait upon them about a fortnight hence, but tis yet an incertainty. What ever the Major reſolves, there muſt be more then appearance that ſhall make me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my intereſt here, though poor and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible: I know the ſtory of <hi>Aeſops</hi> dog, that let fall the fleſh to catch the ſhadow; and you the Moral. The Clock has ſtruck twelve, and my eye-lids grow unruly, therefore take it not ill if I give a dull Farewell, and abruptly call my ſelf, Dear Brother,</p>

               <p>YOu had ſooner ſeen a reply to your laſt, had we not ſtill ſhifted places like feathers in the winds, and too much motion ſtaid my hand. I am ſorry my laſt gave ſo hard a task to your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but am glad it provoked you to breathe your fancy ſo merrily. I ſhould laviſh words to retort your ingenious glances; onely this, if you diſliked the extravagancies in it, ſuffer exceſs of joy to excuſe it, which oft like other paſſions breaks out diſorderly. Well my dear friend, let it ſuffice, there was not a fyllable that was not meant before it was ſaid, and meant becauſe deſerved. But ſince you do not like ſuch Tranſports, I ſhall learn to talk ſoberer, though never to love you with leſſe ardor. All wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have yet appeared ſo indifferent, as the whole Sex was never able to give me a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſs ſuch an one: what the old woman that Fate has marked for mine will do I know not; I think I ſhall honour her venerable wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and reverence her ſpectacles; but ſhe muſt have better linings then that Sex uſe to wear within, before I can love her like ſuch a friend. Another flood of rheume has lately confuted my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115124:45"/>opinion of a cure, and made me recant my brags; but I do not deſpair ſuddenly to make it find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother channel. I pray let your next tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does yet mention the token to you; for if you permit, I can tell how to hint it without reflecting upon you. I am much afflicted, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the ſhortneſs of my chains, when I find I cannot ſerve you as I would, and do wrangle with every acceſſary to our ſtay in this dull Countrey; but all alas to little purpoſe, for our return to <hi>London</hi> is both uncertain and unlikely. Our friends in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> I hope are well, onely my ſiſter <hi>Fenner</hi> is now ſick of the Small-Pox; but in my next I will be able to render you a more particular account of yours, which I ſhall receive from my Brother. If you would write to any there, tis but venturing a requeſt to M. <hi>H.</hi> to deliver it to the <hi>Norfolk</hi>-Poſt, and take their anſwers from him to ſend to you. The man is honeſt and friendly, and I know loves you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do much more: I have excuſed you to him. My Lord returns your reſpects with much affection, and I think has much love for you. Good Sir, reſalute your friend from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſervant with much reſpect, and tell him I ſhall gladly do any thing that may deſerve his love. But I ſhall grow too talkative; I have no more to ſay but to beg you will ſtill underſtand me, as I muſt ever be, my dear friend,</p>

               <p>IT were ſuperfluous to repeat how little the treachery of new objects, freſh acquaintance, long abſence, change of place, &amp;c. is able to do in quenching that affection which I ſhall keep alive with the ſame care that <hi>Vest als</hi> did their ſacred flame. This you have often had under my hand and ſeal; and you may be confident it will never be forfeited. We are again ſetled at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where the advantage of a larger leiſure to write is checked by the ſcarcity of opportunities; but rarity does raiſe the price of delight, we ſet a trivial eſteem upon joyes that come at a low rate, but indulge thoſe we ſweat for: and thus we ſhall entertain our Letters like our ſelves when we meet ſeldom, nothing ſo much endearing the perſonal interview of friends, as when ſome large portion of time has crept betwixt them. As we came down, one of Fortunes ſpightful tricks (of which, I thank her, to me ſhe has always been very liberal) made me loſe the taſte of a pleaſant journey, which was thus; The day of our ſetting our appointed, I conſented to the earneſt ſolicites of my dear Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (then in the Countrey) to let him know
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115124:46"/>it; caus'd by a deſire of his to meet me at S. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> where we had decreed to ſhorten a night together with ſuch mutual ſolace as would have ſuffered its houres to paſs by untold: in hope of this he came little leſs then fourty miles on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which trouble he would needs undertake in lieu of ſome petty ſervices I was happy to do him in his abſence; but upon the brink of our taking leave a Whimſey predominated, and we muſt needs go another way by <hi>Alesbury;</hi> which though I oppoſed as far as I durſt, was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and my hopes of ſo much delight were ſacrificed to an inconvenience; for we went ten miles about for a worſe way, loſt a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Foot-man that were ſent the other, and my vertuous friend (after two nights ſtay) returned with abuſed expectations: I never took a peeviſh chance with leſſe patience. My Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtill continues to afflict me; I pray let the Doctor know with what little ſucceſs I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his preſcriptions, and if he can bethink himſelf of any other courſe that may prove more effectual I ſhall gladly uſe it: I ſee purging will not do it, and the powder never made me ſneeze to purpoſe. Pray tell him I have a ſtrange conceit that ſome Chymical application ſhould effect it. You will much oblige me to propound it to as many skills as you ſhall converſe with, and to ſend me their ſeveral judgements at your beſt convenience, while I ſtrive to do as much
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115124:47"/>where I am. I would not dare to give you this trouble, if I were not confident that you loved</p>

               <p>I Cannot always content my ſelf to ſhut up a ſpeechleſs affection in my breaſt, ſince that amity that wants a tongue may juſtly be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to want a heart, and lie benumb'd like a Snake in Winter; for though Memory and Fancy may poſſibly combine to keep Idea's and Images un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defaced by the hand of time, yet where action is and exerciſe wanting, there is no more then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of life; and that friendſhip that can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lie ſtill, does at beſt but hide it ſelf, and makes as as little harmony as an unſtrung Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>MY deſignes of coming over have been ſo oft diverted by unexpected commands and accidentall emergencies, as I feare my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes have almoſt loſt their credit. But if you knew the vehemencie of my longing to ſee you
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115124:48"/>and the reſt of my friends, you would pitty my impatience (the froward child of ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes.) Divines tell us this life is a Pilgrimage; and if ever any people made it good in both ſenſes I think tis our reſtleſs family: The Sun in his annuall progreſſe through his 12. Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Innes doth not oftener change his Quarters. Ever ſince I knew them I have been nothing but a gueſt, and muſt of neceſſity learne to be a wiſe man if ever I intend to be at home ſo long as I am with them. About two months ſince I had appointed my day to ſet out, when a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain reſolution for a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>-viſit to my Lord <hi>F.</hi> his houſe (retir'd thither to a private life ſince he ungenerall'd himſelf) turn'd my horſe head the contrary way.

I am the more particular in my geſts, leſt you ſhould put my ſilence upon the account of neglect. I had reſolv'd again the laſt Monday to begin my motion Eaſt-ward, and my foot was almoſt in the ſtirrop, when meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Holt</hi>-Poſt, he informed me that my Brother <hi>W.</hi> would be in Town this week; and upon thoſe grounds I defer'd my journey till he returnes home-ward about a fortnight hence, if the ſad increaſe of my malady (which I much ſuſpect) does not arreſt me here; I daily

               <p>I Wiſh my Pen were not ſo indebted to your opinion, as to deſpaire of having right to that Character you have ever given it: but what you call a Garden is little better than a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the thornes and nettles which it plants are onely Roſes in the deceiv'd eyes of affection. Thus the yellow ſands of <hi>Tagus</hi> firſt came by their Gold, not becauſe <hi>Midas</hi> did indeed there waſh off his wiſh, but becauſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and his wiſh too were made on purpoſe to raiſe the Rivers credit by the partiall ingenuity of its Countrimen. Nay, <hi>Tiber</hi> it ſelf (but a brook to our <hi>Thames</hi>) would have made his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to the Ocean with no more noiſe than his own ſtreames make, if it had not taken <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:115124:49"/>in its way, and glided by the walkes of her clear-witted Poets. True Love is wilfully blind to the imperfections of its object; and if the ſcars be not too broad ſhe turnes away her head till her hands hide them in black patches; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the great Architect upon the <hi>Chaos,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing beauty from deformity it ſelf. But to quit Metaphor, I re-thank you you for the vigilance of your active endeavours in behalfe of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; if ever Providence intends me health (which I have too much cauſe to doubt) I think I ſhall owe it to your induſtry; and indeed there is none to whom I would more willingly conſent to be indebted, nor more gladly find a power to requite, than your ſelf: but I confeſs where there is ſuch true amity theſe termes are ſuperfluous. I ſhall gladly receive any thing from the Doctor that may have reference to my cure; but I am afraid I ſhall find ſome difficulty to be a circumſpect obſerver of his preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for we are here rather a crowd than a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and are rather quarter'd like an Army than lodg'd, few chambers deſerving better titles than huts. But I hope we ſhall ſhortly march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; however if I receive ought that may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any pretence to a remedy, I ſhall ſtruggle hard both for time and place to take it as I ought. I thank you for the Hiſtory of your High-<hi>Suffolk</hi>-journey: I ſhall take ſome order to lay the ſtorme of my Siſter <hi>P's.</hi> unkindneſſe, if the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115124:49"/>weake magick of my pen can do it; for if there be any Art in it, you know tis black. For what concernes the Recognizance, I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till your progreſſion teach me both how to ſpeak and do. I made no queſtion but to be as big as my word when my laſt talk'd of your two ſtickes coming down; but having ſince met with the Majors Maſculine wife, She tells me that it will be <hi>Michalemas</hi> before ſhe makes any more; but ſhe has promis'd that the patience of your expectation ſhall be then rewarded with the Maſter-piece of her art. Honeſt <hi>J.</hi> is ready to beat his wife that ſhe forces his promiſe to ſo ſlothfull a performance; he ſalutes you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, and ſeemes alwaies to be thirſty when he drinks your health.

And though Fortune has not ſmiled upon my longing for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, by beſtowing ſucceſs on your kind endeavours, yet I have taught my ſoul as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to relliſh the real intention, as if its greedy deſires had been feaſted with the effectual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. I confeſſe my hopes took a ſad fall in Sir <hi>T. B.</hi> but I had rather be content with the misfortune then that it ſhould procure you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with the man. Sir, I find it fit to acquaint you that tis now my reſolution to break the chains of that unthrifty liberty that has all this time led my wandring ſteps from the path of imployment; to which, (rather then ſacrifice any more of the precious off-ſpring of Time to the idol of Idlenes) tis my vow to lure my ſoaring deſires to a more humble flight; and ſince their wings are too weak in a forraign ſhore to make prudential Experience their Quarry, Humility
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115124:50"/>ſhall train them to ſtoop at a domeſtick prey: the means of which (ſo it be not baſe or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt) I ſhall want pride enough to diſdain. Nor did I ever want jealouſie that the unskilful weakneſſe of my worthleſs parts would render me an unfit Pilot to be imbarqued at firſt in the managing of a Secretaries place; and my now becalmed thoughts reliſh it as a prevention of ſome diſgrace by the kinde Providence, that my feeble ſailings might have betraid me to. In ſumm, not only the covet of my own deſires, but the promiſes of ſome friends have incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to be at <hi>London</hi> at <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, where I expect (if I am not wide) to hit ſome happy opportunity of imployment; to further which, I hope you will vouchſafe him your teſtimony that alwayes was, and ever will be</p>

It is fit you ſhould believe that I am not onely contented to wiſh you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but would be glad I could make you ſo, by ſomething elſe beſides words; but Providence thinks it fit that I ſhould ſtill be unable to ſerve the friends I love, and therefore defers my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment by prolonging my unfortunate malady.

If ſometimes then I ſend you my thoughts undreſt, blame the haſte that poſts them away in ſuch a ruffled manner. I am glad you incountred ſo much pleaſure in going your uſual rounds, and peruſed the kind intertainment of ſo many friends, to whom I ought to conclude my ſelf ingaged, that they cannot ſuffer my diſappearing from their ſight to deprive me of a harbor in their thoughts.

There is an old acquaintance of yours in Town which ſome call Mrs. <hi>E. F.</hi> and though ſhe preſents her kind reſpects to you, yet ſhe cannot conceal that ſhe takes your long ſilence ſomething unkindly; three or four lines to her while ſhe is here (which will be a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night) will mend the fault. Want of time and paper releaſes you from further trouble, and gives you the farewell of</p>

               <p>YOur laſt parcel of Paper I received, not without admiring your skill in contraction, that could put ſo exact a Letter in the bounds of a Note. Methought it appeared like a fruitful ſpot of earth, whoſe fertility made amends for its narrow Continent. Your ſilence had been better excuſed with any Plea, then the want of complement, for that is a commodity I never had any uſe for: tis a faint ſickly friendſhip that is fed with ſuch weak nouriſhment; and excuſe me if I ſay I ſhould make but an ill bargain to exchange my ſtrong well-woven reality for ſuch ſlim ſleaſie ſtuff. It is a Leſſon onely fit to be learned in the infancy of acquaintance, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to be forgotten in the progreſs: it is the crime of my miſtake if ours be not march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far beyond it, and it muſt not be my fault if ever we ſound a retreat. I could wiſh propitious Fame would put you to the charge of more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and tell you ſuch things, as would ask to be expreſt in your paler Ink; but we muſt patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait Divine leiſure. I thank you for your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick intelligence. I pray in your next let me know exactly how the Treaty ſucceeds. We

               <p>SInce I aſcribe your laſt weeks ſilence rather to accident then deſign, I cannot juſtly take that advantage to ſay nothing; but eſpecially ſince my ſudden removal to a more remote place is like to heighten the price of theſe opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I muſt have leave to cheriſh this, and like the parting of a pair of Lovers, to hug it with a tedious tenderneſs. For ſince neceſſity has made another my owner, I muſt bow my will to her proud injunctions, and ſuffer her quietly to ſtrip it of that happy power that gave me the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of intention and determination: thus letting go the hold I had in my diſpoſal, I muſt now like a Cock-boat ſuffer my ſelf to be towed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſail; or like an inferiour ſpring or wheel, obey the impulſion of a greater. My Lady <hi>C.</hi> is already in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> whither I am to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my Lord the next week; how long our ſtay will be I know not, but I fear too tedious, unleſs

But I thought it more fit to ſtay the ſtomach of my hungry fortunes with this bit, then to ſuffer them to famiſh in the vain expectation of a plenteous feaſt. If I had not learned the trick to be at home every where, this journey would have put me to ſome trouble; for I am to begin my acquaintance with every creature in that family, and to part with another, that if I be not mine own flatterer, do both know and love me. While I am there I ſhall be induſtrious to give you the true viſage of my own particular affairs, and ſometimes a touch of the general.

               <p>ENmity has domineered ſo long, that amity is almoſt grown out of countenance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; yet to this dear commodity I am indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a double reaſon; firſt becauſe ſhe was never more refined by perſecution then now, Vice having this good property, that the injuries it does its oppoſite Vertue often prove her tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, and ſet her off with more lovely luſtre; but ſhe is chiefly beholding to your vertues for the height of my eſteem, the acquaintance with which I would not ſell for a more gaudy jewel, to loſe or forfeit which, by neglect, were worſe then for a School-boy to loſe his leſſon; or an Artificer to ſell his tools: this through the glaſs of your modeſty may appear like flattery, but if brought to the touch-ſtone of your worth, it will appear truths naked mettal, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in the Alchimy of Diſſimulation. For newes, that which is bad has lately got ſo much unhappy truth of its ſide, that I may well ſay its good news that there is no news at all. I do here wait upon imployment, like him that is ſick of the contagion of Love, upon a froward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris; and ſhe has yet uſed me like that handſome

               <p>THough I believe you are in my debt for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Letters, yet becauſe you do not uſe to be ſo ſlow a Pay-maſter of ſuch obligations, I am willing to ſuſpect that Fortune has uſed them as ſhe oft does Travellers that undertake long and dangerous voyages, ſaluting their ſayles with contrary winds, that either affront their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a forced delay, or wreck them and their deſires together: however I ſhall continue to ſhoot one ſhaft after another, till I find you have found ſome of them. By this undaunted perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance you may gueſſe how well I eſteem what comes from you; and I ſhall not need o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rhetorick then what lives in your own breaſt to ſet your Pen awork; if you fancy as much delight in the task as I do, to give it the title of Pain will be to miſcall it. We live in a Town, the deſcription of which ſhall ſerve to ſwell this Letter to the ordinary bulk. Firſt, it is ſeated upon a firm Rock, which makes moſt of the meaneſt inhabitants to live like <hi>Troglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites,</hi> or Conies, under ground, and are onely obliged to the Pickax and Matock for their Manſion. It is beſet with ſuch a variety of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115124:61"/>Natures bleſſings, as I know not whether it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords more ſatisfaction to the eye that hunts for profitable objects, or that which gads after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ones. On the one ſide it is overlooked by Hills of ſuch a ſtature, as will require ſome pain to climbe, but double requite it when you are up; as if Nature had wiſely contrived a little difficulty in the purchaſe, on purpoſe to indear the poſſeſſion: their proud browes are fann'd with ſuch a delicious Aire, as if it be true that Cameleons receive no other food, here they might have a continual feaſt; here the eye may dally with a ſweet variety of proſpect, and is hardly perſwaded to be weary, becauſe ſo much diverſity does refreſh and renew the pleaſure; there you have a full view of the flowry fruitful Meads that (creſcent-wiſe in a rich bravery) court this ſweet ſcituation with ſemicircular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: the feet of it are waſhed by the ſilver-<hi>Trent,</hi> which ſeems to murmure as he paſſes by that he is forced to ſwim away from the ſociety of ſo many beauties. If you ſend your Opticks further, they are intertained with goodly houſes, fair Churches, ſhady Groves, and with a Caſtle the ſame that was entred from a vault by King <hi>Edward</hi> III. when he raviſhed <hi>Mortimer</hi> from his mother armes, that (ſtanding upon a tall firm rock) ſeems to bid defiance to time, and ſcorns to take his ruine the ordinary way by having his heels tript up by a fundamental decay. I have
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115124:61"/>dwelt the longer upon theſe my ſilent compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they are the beſt ſociety I converſe with; for conſider how the new-found world (where the earth was lin'd with Gold) was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and you have my meaning; onely here's the difference, they were new people to their diſcoverers, and ſimple, theſe are of the new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and crafty: Onely I am very happy in an old <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman that ſerveth my Lady Dowager, one of the beſt Linguiſts in <hi>England;</hi> under his tuition I am now a ſerious ſtudent of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and have almoſt gained a general Theorical knowledge in the Language; within ſome few weeks I ſhall proceed to <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which will be much an eaſier task: you may make a ſilent queſtion, what profit I expect to reap from a few varied fruitleſs words; but when I have gained them I ſhall eaſily ſolve that doubt, and let you know how I will make it give larger ſcope to my narrow condition here, or elſe tranſplant my ſelf where I may thrive better. My trouble ſtill continues, and is like to do while I am here; for this town affords none that profeſs the <hi>Eſculapian</hi> art, but onely one old dull thing, who when I tried him in ſome diſcourſe, could quote nothing but <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> and made me a very dexterous diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115124:62"/>for if it be incurable, I ſhall try to make the beſt uſe of my own deſpair, and force a ſatisfaction from reaſon, ſince I can have it from nought elſe. I pray ask him if he thinks letting bloud in the temples would not be good, or whether an iſſue in my neck would not infallibly check the courſe of the humor; but I confeſſe I am ſcarce willing to try that, till I ſee all the reſt fail: if you can prevail with him, let me intreat you to get a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the neezing Powder, and incloſe it in yours; for though I do not hope a cure from it, yet it may ſtay the increaſe of the humor till I take ſome ſtronger medicine. If your affaires ſhall call you to <hi>Norwich,</hi> or if you can ſend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to my ſiſter <hi>F.</hi> to do it, I would gladly have the opinion of Dr. <hi>B.</hi> from whoſe advice I fancy moſt hope of all. I would not be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give him a fee; for if a cure be to be bought, I would not ſtick to pay for it with all I can make, rather then go without it. Well, Brother excuſe this trouble, and be confident that if ever you have occaſion to call my love to the tryal, either to ſerve your deſires, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, or both, you ſhall clearly find that I am no leſſe then totally</p>

               <p>I Can think of no other interpretation for your ſilence but that you keep it to puniſh the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of ſome of my lateſt letters, and ſo I am made a ſufferer for Fortunes fault: if ſo, let this deprecate my imputation of neglect; and did I not conceive that ſome of yours have met with the ſame misfortune, I ſhould ſeverely examine my ſelf how I have deſerved to be forgotten. However you reſent your indeavours that way, I ſhall not injure judgement to indulge affection, if I ſay that I never read any thing with more delight then your lines, and ſo oft as I receive them, in ſpite of all my melancholy and the cauſe of it, they remember me that I am happy. If I were not ſtill like a ſhip that has loſt her anchor, and can therefore take no courſe but what ſhe is driven to by the imperious windes, I had long ſince landed in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and there unla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my breaſt into your ear: but though my longings be ſtill green and vigorous, my opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, like vegetals that die to revive again, are faded with the ſeaſon; but they will bud with the eldeſt children of the Spring, and I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115124:64"/>ſhall be gathered at their firſt appearance. The main cauſe is, my Lady ſuddenly expects to increaſe the world by one more at leaſt; and though I can never be leſs uſeful then in thoſe feminine tumults, yet great ones love at ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn troubles to have their ſervants preſence ſignifie they have ſuch pertinents; and thus I muſt ſtay to piece up formality, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affair of being at home will be gravely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in making a ſhow that I am ſo. I have nothing to acquaint you with but what you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know, &amp;c. This is the third ſince I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any from your ſelf; but I adventured to ſend them by ſome wool-men that came out of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln-ſhire</hi> to your parts; but if this miſcarry too, which goes the ſame way, I will never truſt men more whoſe wits go a wool-gathering: the inch of time that is allowed me to ſcrible this, makes me commit as many errors as there are lines, and make as many blots as words, for I ſend this by my Ladies Bailiff into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in haſte; and by plain force have rent this time from my other preſſing occaſions, thus to ſin over my good will: do but pardon this, and the next week you ſhall have amends by the Poſt.

               <p>He had, by the affability of his carriage, the ſolidity of his parts, and the ſucceſs of his skill, purchaſed a high eſteem with the beſt; beſides the good will of all that knew him, having done many cures there, by relation, that might have proved problematical to the moſt grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed experience. When an unfortunate cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity got into the head of young Mr. <hi>Bendiſh,</hi> eldeſt ſon to the Ambaſſadour, to take a voyage to the Holy-Land, and particularly to <hi>Hieruſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to ſee the Holy-Sepulchre, with other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and repoſitories that Time has not yet quite effaced there; the fathers opinion of his prudence, made him joyn his authority with the ſons amity, and his own curioſity, to make him a companion in this voyage. So they ſet out from <hi>Galata</hi> in <hi>February</hi> 1649. travelled by land to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and there went aboard the <hi>Talent,</hi> which was bound for <hi>Lighorn,</hi> which young <hi>Bendiſh</hi> reſolved to take in his way, with deſign to ſee a ſiſter of his married there to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, and ſo take his way by <hi>Scanderon;</hi> but paſſing by <hi>Porto Longone,</hi> which ſince the <hi>French</hi> had it, has been the <hi>Dunkirk</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> much about the time that the news arrived there of the fatal blow was given to Monarchy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:115124:66"/>their ſhip was aſſaulted by divers <hi>French</hi> men of war, who then took all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without diſtinction, for enemies; and maintaining a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fight with them for ſome hours, at laſt an unfortunate bullet from the enemy happened into their Gun-room, and fired the Ship; the heat of the fight would not allow them leiſure to hinder it till it was paſt hope of extinguiſhing. Mr. <hi>Bendiſh</hi> leapt over-board, and ſwam to the ſide of one of the enemies Ships; but they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly cut off one of his hands, that had laid hold of the Ships ſide to climbe the Deck, and ſo ſent him to feed fiſhes: poor Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſtaid in the Ship, and in all probability periſhed by the more furious Element; onely one Gentleman, called Mr. <hi>L.</hi> eſcaped, which after the recepit of many wounds, had quarter given him, and was carried to <hi>Porto Longone;</hi> where the danger of his life being paſt, he was forced to buy his liberty, and returning to <hi>Lighorn</hi> made this relation, the ſame man is now in <hi>Genua.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> left behind him at <hi>Galata,</hi> in the cuſtody of his man one <hi>T. M.</hi> two cheſts full of rich drugs, many ſilver inſtruments, beſides wearing apparel and linnen, tis ſaid he left a ſumme of money beſides, but of how much, or with whom, is uncertain: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this <hi>M.</hi> is now reputed worth three or four hundred pound, though before this in but a poor condition, he now ſerves the Ambaſſadour. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> left a Shapet of <hi>Turkey</hi>-Carpets and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115124:66"/>Hangings, which in all probability he deſigned for <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Lighorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to ſet aſide all thoſe fatherleſs Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that fly abroad, as of the loſſe of all our Armies, Infantry, and Carriages, with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals being taken priſoner, &amp;c. the trueſt and moſt modeſt intelligence tells us, that our Army being at <hi>Pinkland-hills,</hi> which is weſtward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about eight miles, had notice that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was riſen, and upon their march towards <hi>Sterling;</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> made us preſently riſe with ours, &amp; with all expedition endeavour to prevent that retreat: the truth is, we did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march them, but tis more then probable they ſuffered us to do it by deſign, for they have ſince taken our ſtation upon <hi>Pinkland-hills,</hi> ſo as our Army is now got into ſuch a ſtreight, as they muſt either fight upon local diſadvantages, or indure the extremities of much want in that penurious Countrey, before they can reach their ſhipping. The laſt Poſt but one ſaid the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were drawn up in Battalia in view of each other; but we are not yet ſuffered to know they have fought, though I am confident there hath been a ſignal battel, which gives the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnants high hopes, becauſe our Grandees doe think fit to conceal the event of it. Letters from <hi>Holland</hi> ſpeak very partially on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide, and talk of a great victory they have lately gotten; Believe what you pleaſe of it,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115124:67"/>for my part I am ſomething incredulous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we make no more haſte with our ſupplies thither. We lately ſeized upon eight ſhips laden with Merchandiſe belonging to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> which hath given occaſion to the States Ambaſſadour to complain of it to the Houſe, and call it in very diſobliging terms a breach of League, but we hear not yet of a reſtitution. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour made a paſſionate complaint to the Houſe of the interception of his Packet and breaking open his Letters laſt Week; but he had good words given him, and a promiſe it ſhould no more be ſo; onely tis thought the ſparing of Mr. <hi>Aſhcombs</hi> murderers hath made us a little angry, and jealous that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> profeſſes more friendſhip then he means. There is a Letter intercepted, from the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the <hi>Scots</hi> King, which aſſures him he has gained his deſires upon the refractory <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> and in a ſhort time will be able to ſend him the ſuccours of men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which he promiſed, leaving the time and place to his appointment: Report ſayes he hath 14000. men, whereof 2000. <hi>German</hi> Horſe, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſhipped, upon what deſign none knowes: It ſeems they are raiſed by contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the King of <hi>Danemark,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> with other <hi>German</hi> Princes. The <hi>Scots</hi> King has lately made <hi>Inchequin</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115124:67"/>of his Forces in <hi>Ireland;</hi> who with his Army, made conſiderable by the addition of the Garriſon-forces of <hi>Dungannon, Carlow</hi> and <hi>Waterford,</hi> is now in <hi>Connaught,</hi> and promiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſucceſſeful Winter. It ſeems he was glad to be rid of thoſe Gariſons, by reaſon of the plague which rages there, even to the depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of whole Towns; and appears by a moſt pitiful Declaration ſet out by General <hi>Ireton,</hi> which invites not onely his own party, but all Chriſtian Nations, and the very Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to joyn in a humiliation to God for the ceſſation of his judgements upon them.</p>
               <p>This being my laſt that I am like to write from <hi>London,</hi> I have ventured to be the more tedious, and the rather becauſe my ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time hath hardly ſuffered me to make it ſence; but you know lame things are objects of charity, and pity my preſent indiſpoſition that aſſiſted my precipitate haſte to make it ſo. I dare not ſay more, leſt the Poſts departure make me ſay nothing, and ſo ſpoyl this Paper-riddle that brings you the elder Siſter in the belly of the yongeſt. Dear Brother fare well.</p>

               <p>AT laſt with much ado we are grown Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens again, where ſince we lighted, we have ſcarce had time to prune our feathers; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my haſte has ſnatched up this piece of a wing to tell you I received yours of the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> with a reſentment raiſed to a fit height to meaſure with the tall ſtrong affection that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it. I was about to ſay there was not a word in it but deſerved a ſeveral welcome; but at the inſtant I threw my eye upon ſome praiſes which I dare not intertain; and if your love had but truſted your judgement, you had left them out. Diſtance deceives with both extremes, by preſenting objects to the eye too little, to the apprehenſion too big: we no ſooner begin to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115124:69"/>fancy any thing that is not with us, but we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently mend all its diſproportions, and ſhut our eyes upon every blemiſh: this imperfection is almoſt as old as mankind, and few breaſts can boaſt they never harboured it. I have grumbled at my Stars for placing ſome things beyond my reach, which I apprehended would make me happy, and yet I have ſeen them poſſeſſed by thoſe that were quickly weary, &amp; little leſs then diſpleaſed at what I overvalued. But I ſtraggle. This Town is ſo metamorphos'd by this laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſince I left it, that bating my dead Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, there is ſcarce any thing that I can know with ſafety. Certainly there is a mighty ſtorm ariſing, but where, when, or how it will ſpend its fury, I dare not name. Errour has humbled my Reaſon, and unbuſied my reaches at futurity to a quiet reſignation to the great Diſpoſer. I cannot ſay my malady is more remiſs then it was, and have little reaſon to hope it ever will be; but for that I told you my reſolution, which has ſince loſt no ſpirits. My trivial imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not ſuffer'd me yet to ſtruggle withit this Spring, but I am now about it. I ſent you a Letter by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which I believe you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; he had carried it with him into <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> thinking to find me there, for we ſet upon this journey on a ſudden, &amp;c.

I know you are Miſtriſs of goodneſs enough to pardon the flow payment of my word, and it ſhall encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to amend it with future diligence. You will much oblige to honour me with a line or two, and let me know how the ſtate ſtands in your Family, and when we are like to bid you welcome into the Countrey. One requeſt more and I have done; put me into the number of thoſe that you count your moſt faithful friends, for indeed I am, and ever will be ſo, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I See you will make me an uſurper againſt my will, by laying deſert enough to my charge, to dazle the Eyes of Pretence, and even ſtagger the ſtouteſt undertaking reſolution. I confeſſe I cannot keep off ſome wiſhes to be what you would make me; and if I could arme as much power as deſire, tis poſſible I might endanger the Fort you ſay I am Maſter of; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to diſlike my own weakneſs that I am not ſo: but I have too much Earth about me to fit my ſelfe for ſuch a flight, that with dull intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtill ſeducing me downwards to its own Element, and hangs like a huge Plummet upon my pinions, when they are ſtretching at ſuch a pitch: ſure ſome pale flegmatick conſtellation threw a melancholy look upon my Nativity, and gave my Soul theſe blunt ill-temper'd tooles to work with: methinks I cannot behold the time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages of other Conſtitutions, and not upbraid my own. But certainly tis not amiſſe in ſome things to be unhappy, for if wants do not ingender deſpair, they muſt needes be fruitfull. Wiſdom is a Coy Dame to all the World, but moſt inflexible to the Courtſhip of Fortunes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115124:74"/>Darlings; and tis one of the beſt reaſons why that blind Wenches ſmiles are dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis ſo hard a taske to taſt her kindneſs, and not ſurfeit; and indeed not to overvalue thoſe ingredients with which common opinion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds her falſe felicity, is the way to purchaſe the true one.</p>
               <p>If I were able to ſhew you events as <hi>Aſtolfo's Logiſtilla</hi> ſhew'd the race of the Houſe of <hi>Eſte</hi> before their Conception, I would not hide them from you, though I kept the reſt of the World in ignorance; but tis long ſince I left off the pretences to <hi>Delphick</hi> divination, and reſolv'd to ſhut the eyes of my Reaſon, ever ſince ſhe look'd through ſo falſe a Perſpective. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that are now in the Saddle do ſit very ſure, and while they keep their feet in the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups of ſtrength and vigilance, though they may receive a rude ſhock, it will be hard to unhorſe them. I ſhould be glad if you could keep your ſhelter till the Clouds clear up; but whenſoever you leave it, you have parts that will make room for you in the World, whereever you direct your ſteps; and I ſhall never take a temporal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more gratefully of Providence, than a capacity to ſerve you in ſuch a deſign, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>THough I had a confidence in your affection, that can never be tempted to be leſſe, yet methinks I ſhould not do right to your laſt, if I did not confeſs that it ſet my apprehenſion to work upon your perfect friendſhip: things may be incapable of addition that are not of agitation: there are ſome generous liquors that never give ſo clear a proof that they have ſpirits, as when motion calls them to their active task; ſo theſe deare repetitions of profeſt amity from you, though they cannot make me love you better, they wake it into a better appearing, and teach me to take a more exact account of my ſelfe, of the right you have in me; and theſe (if you dare believe me) are my pleaſanteſt recreations, ſince love (the parent and framer of delight) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates in the employment. If this world be well ſcann'd, there is nothing valuable in it but a true Friend: Community is not only the hinge of the Univerſe, but the ſignet of every ſingle delight; for were it poſſible to domineere over the whole Earth (pack'd into an intire Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy) and to be Maſter of all that weares the ſtamp of ſublunary happineſs, yet if the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115124:75"/>be not allow'd to latch his own felicity (at the rebound from others approbation) he will but brood his tireſome pleaſures as an Uſurer does his Gold, only own, not uſe them; and all his Joyes (like Witches banquets) will only ſeeme and ſerve to cheat the appetite with a few falſe promiſes of ſweetneſs. It were eaſie to prove, that, ſince communication coines our earthly delight, that there it comes neereſt to perfection, where it receives a Copy of it ſelfe. By this it is fit you ſhould gueſſe how happy I deeme my ſelfe in your kind invitation, which is backed with abundance of ſuch tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments as Love and Reaſon, when they are joyned in Commiſſion, do uſe to urge; and believe it they are received as the legitimate iſſue of your intire affection: what reſentments ſuch uſe to produce in a breaſt that has no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ingratitude, cannot poſe your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; by that fancy the influence they muſt have in me, and therein read my thankfulneſſe. But the quality of my imployment here is ſuch, as I know it cannot yet conſent to make me ſo happy. I have now almoſt deſtroyed a yeares time in this ſcurvy Country, ſince we laſt wandred from <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> You may finde out many reaſons to induce you to accept my Couzin <hi>C</hi>'s invitation of your Company into <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> I ſhall not need to mention my wiſhes to ſee you there, nor tell you how happy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115124:75"/>you will make me in ſuch a meeting, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition is needleſs: if you come while I am on this ſide <hi>London,</hi> I will injoy you in ſpite of all my Fetters; but make as much haſt as you can, for this morning my Lord told me we ſhould ſet out for <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> Your Picture I received, and am ſory I have no token to return you, that may deliver a viſible Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of my gratitude; it is applauded of all that ſee it, onely your Pencil has left out ſome gray haires that the Epilogue of his misfortunes had planted on his viſage. I have inclos'd the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mad fantaſtick Dream, which is the fruit of my firſt Enterpriſe upon the French Tongue; I met it in a Romance call'd <hi>Francion,</hi> and it pleaſed me ſo well, as I was eaſily inticed to ſpoyl it thus into Engliſh. I was tempted to make the whole Book ſpeak the ſame Dialect, but could not conſent to loſe ſo much time as the work would have demanded. Read it over, laugh at it, and return it again when I come to <hi>London;</hi> and now I have almoſt tyr'd my Pen and your patience, it is time to ſubſcribe my ſelfe, as I ever muſt be,</p>

Indeed Sir, I have ſeverely examined my ſelf for the words I let fall that might provoke this gloſſe; and my memory can acknowledge none but thoſe: When your brother asked me when I would write to you, I told him you were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in my ſcore for a Letter, and till you had leiſure to reply to that, I thought my ſilence might be well taken. If theſe words will bearſuch a Comment as diſpleaſure, &amp;c. I am ſorry I did not underſtand them, and do beg the charity of your belief that I did not mean them as they are taken. I have been taught to prize your good thoughts at a higher value then to forfeit them with ſuch a frantick piece of arrogance, which would render me as weak an underſtander of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115124:77"/>your worth, as a deſerver of your friendſhip. I was in good hope when we left <hi>London,</hi> if a ſudden occaſion had not prevented, to pay you my perſonal thanks for your kind invitation; but we rather dwelt then viſited by the way at my Lords of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerlands,</hi> ſo as we are but newly arrived at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where my Commanders have found me ſuch imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as will ſcarce diſpenſe with my abſence on this ſide <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and when I come, though I muſt bring that along with me that will give me a better title to your contempt then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet I make my ſelf happy with the hopes of an opportunity to aſſure you that I am not the ſame which miſinterpretation had made, but will ever be induſtrious to appear,</p>

               <p>BY this time you have accuſed my abſence and ſilence of much unkindneſs, and I ſtand condemned by your judgement for a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful promiſe breaker; and indeed did the reins lie looſe upon my neck, I ſhould deſerve the cenſure. I confeſſe the receipt of a Letter from you that overflowed with Love; and, if I have not loſt all my credit with you, be confident I met it with as high a tide of affection. I ſhould have return'd a Paper to tell you ſo, but that I cheriſht ſome forward hopes to do the meſſage with more content to us both in perſon. When yours came we every day talk'd of leaving <hi>London,</hi> though our ſtay was prolonged from day to day, above ſix weeks after; and when we did, we conſum'd as much time in coming down: and thus my ardent deſires to ſee my friends were dallied into torment; and I brookt the delay ſo much the worſe, becauſe I I had ſtill a likelyhood in gaze: but now I am forced to wait with an extended patience for a remoter opportunity; for the Lady that I wait upon has got a belly ſo big, as till that ſwelling falls, and the thing be made a Chriſtian,

               <p>I Am glad to ſee you are ſo well arm'd againſt your Domeſtick Enemies, and can pull out the ſtings of vexation ſo dexterouſly: tis a Science that comprizes the whole art of living happily; and he that has perfectly learn'd it is rich in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of the frowns, and without an obligation to the fawnes of Fortune. Diſcontent is the Gout of the minde, and ſo much the harder to be cur'd becauſe it is hereditary, and as old as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in poſterity; but if we often repair to the great Phyſitian, he is alwayes able, and for the moſt part willing, to eaſe us: though it ſprings from the wombs of various cauſes, that are themſelves complex'd in the concupiſcible and iraſcible faculties; yet moſt commonly it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from a ſurfeit of unſatisfied deſires, which run madding after that they cannot have; or if ſometimes they chance to overtake it, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are as much tyr'd with the fruition, as before perplext with the defect; and like Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, reap more delight in the game than the Quarrie. But I draw faces with a blunt Coal. We are ſuddenly reſolv'd to morrow without fail to begin our Journey to the Bath, and ſo
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115124:81"/>from thence almoſt to the Lands end Weſtward; which precipitate reſolution does almoſt put me to my wits end, having ſo little elbow-roome of time for preparation: this makes me that I can yet ſay nothing to the latter part of your Letter; and when my leiſure is largeſt, my poor abilities will not let me ſay much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, however I ſhall ſtretch them to an equall contribution in that charitable deſign. My mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of buſineſs does you a kindneſs, and ſhortens your trouble, by inforcing me to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my ſelfe, Dear Brother,</p>

               <p>I Am adviſed by many reaſons to copy your content for my neerer approches, but none ſo powerfull as what you alledged; for, believe it, I ſtudy nothing with more circumſpection and delight, than to preſerve the perfect heat and health of our friendſhip from thoſe cold Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that uſe to ruine others. I am proud of my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115124:82"/>friends affection, though not their praiſes: yet I could wiſh (though only to ſave the credit of their Judgements) that the one were as due as the other. Pray return my ſervice to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> when you ſee him next, and tell him I am much in his debt for being preſerv'd in his thoughts. I could never be at quiet with a Book-ſeller, till I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make him ready the ſecond part of <hi>Hymens Praeludia</hi> againſt the next Terme; but my ſhort allowance of time will inforce me to huddle it up in ſuch haſt, as if I got any credit by the firſt, I have much reaſon to feare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will forfeit it: he offer'd to be at the charge of cutting my own face for the Frontiſpiece; but I rejected his offer, reſolving the World ſhould have no cauſe to ſmile at the vanity in putting my Picture to a paltry Tranſlation; but finding him ſtill eager to put a gay before his Book, I deſign'd him this, which is now a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, — upon an Altar dedicated to Love, divers hearts transfix'd with Arrowes and Darts are to lye broyling upon the Coals; and upon one of the ſteps of it <hi>Hymen</hi> is repreſented in the habit of a high Prieſt, with a Miter on his head, a Cenſer in one hand, and a Taper in the other, holding it in a poſture as if he were going to light it at the Altar; when <hi>Cupid</hi> is to come behind him, and pull him by the ſaffron-ſleeve, with theſe words proceeding from his mouth, <hi>Nondum peracta ſunt praeludia,</hi> as much as to ſay,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115124:82"/>Tis not time to light your Mariage Taper, for the wooings are not paſt: which alludes to the unfiniſhed Story, as well by the Author as the Tranſlator.

               <p>MY laſt weeks failing was not becauſe I did not write; but I think my woman was drunk that uſually calls for my Letters, and ſo let the laſt lie like a dead Commodity in my hands, reſembling ſome inſects here, that are born, live and die to no purpoſe. I ſhall not have room enough in this to raiſe a bank againſt the overflow of your unmerited praiſes, and confute the height of your eſteem as I ought: but it ſhall be my task to make the beſt uſe of them, and make that my mark which you have made my Quarry; for ſince they are not Eſſences, as your
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115124:86"/>good opinion would have them, tis but fit I ſhould keep them by me here as Idea's for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know not the conſtitution of your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts where you are, and therefore cannot judge whether they be healthful or ſickly; onely I know your ingenuity is ſo well tempered with Judgement, as you need no aſſiſtance at the forge of your own fortunes; all then I have to do in relation to that, is to wiſh all your hopes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and your feares impoſtors. I know not what to ſay to the Bark you ſpoke of, becauſe I am ignorant how ſhe is built, and therefore can give no opinion whether ſhe be worth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but tis yours and not mine that muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep you aſhore, or ſet you aboard; in the mean time methinks her Lading is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, eſpecially being to be coupled with your induſtry. I delivered your Letter to Mr. <hi>M. W.</hi> who reſents your well-expreſt affection very kindly, and deſired me to give it you ſo with his ſervice. I need not ſay more of my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Friend Mr. <hi>W.</hi> than you find, or at leaſt may apprehend, by judging what he is by what he ſayes; and believe it he is no diſſembler. There was nothing but my haſt in fault that I did not acquaint you with the contents of my Siſter <hi>J</hi>'s.

I hope I need not conjure you by all that here is dear betwixt us, to ſtrain your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in <hi>J</hi>'s behalf, who has deſerv'd ſo well of us all: her other Friends that approve Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Propoſitions may perhaps look no further then the Bark; but I know you will not content your ſelf with likelyhoods and appearances, without a ſubtile and ſolid penetration into true beings and realities; and I ſhall never doubt that metall that comes with approbation from your touch-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My Meſſenger ſtayes for my Letter, which poſts me to a period.

               <p>I Should be as unwilling to be overpriz'd as undervalu'd, ſince every man is oblig'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as ſtrict a guard of modeſty as courage. There are ſome ſpecies of vertue (according to Moraliſts) though they all aim at the ſame mark, and agree in their end, yet in their operation are ſo vaſtly diſcrepant (not to ſay contrarious) as they are ſcarce compatible in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and thus (unleſs the oeconomy of our ſelves be very cautiouſly manag'd) to con one vertue thoroughly, is to forget another; nor can there be an higher proof of wiſdom, nor is man ever ſo exact a Microcoſme, as when, in imitation of the Elements, oppoſite qualities are equally mingled to a juſt temperament, and ſo tame themſelves to a perfect harmony. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to yours; had the Frontiſpiece of it been drawn by another Pen, it would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtu'd Complement; but from you I give it the uſuall reception, and only believe (though the expreſſions much overtop me) Love guided your hand when you ſet down thoſe miſtakes. To judge aright is a task ſo difficult, as they that come neereſt (bating things demonſtrative) may
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115124:89"/>be rather ſaid to fancy, then attain it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally every man being ſubject (at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) either to opinion, paſſion, or partiality, great enemies to a cleare Judgement: but I ſhew the weakneſs of mine, by tiring you with theſe unneceſſaries. This week contributes little ſatisfaction to your appetite of newes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I out-run the Conſtable: Dear Brother,</p>

You had not been laſt Week unſaluted, if an accidental emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency had not ſnatcht my Pen out of my hand, and alarum'd my obedience to an indiſpenſable imployment (impoſed by the commands of thoſe I ſerve) which ſwallowed all the time that offered the opportunity.

Preſent me cordially to my Brother, and tell him, if I thought I ſhould not loſe my labour, he ſhould not receive them thus by a glance, but by a level point-blanck from my pen. You may aſſure <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> I have no more leaves to take, unleſs he will give me leave to wiſh his wit may never ſhrink in the wearing, nor his mirth in the wetting, ſo long as he has uſe for them.

Your decoction no doubt was very ſafe, and the admixture of <hi>Diagridium</hi> and <hi>Sal Abſynthii</hi> not improper; but believe it, this conſtant taking away the bran by an artificial Sive, does but tye the hands of Nature, which if let looſe &amp; at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no doubt would do it better her ſelf: health haſtened by a Phyſical aſſiſtance is like fruits ripen'd by artificiall glaſſes, which are neither ſo fair to the eye, grateful to the taſt, nor ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting as thoſe that ſtay the leiſure of time for a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115124:95"/>genuine maturity, and I am confident that a good Diet, moderate Exerciſe, and a merry heart, are the moſt ſoveraign Remedies you can take to perfect your recovery. My Brother <hi>W.</hi> came hither on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, and parted hence for <hi>Oxford</hi> on <hi>Tueſday;</hi> his Brother the Major keepes him company in the Journey, he excuſed it, that he did not viſit you by the way, and is reſolv'd to mend his fault in his return, which I believe will be about <hi>Tueſday</hi> next; I think we ſent your Ague to flight by drinking your health. I pretend not to any confidence, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belief of what my laſt told you in reference to newes, but rather take it as the child of ſome ſingle conjectures, that are ever limming likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of what they would have, and conceiting themſelves into their priſtine happineſs; yet I will not ſweare that all is Apocrypha. I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Welſh Prophet here, one <hi>E.</hi> which ſeldom dreames without a Revelation, or ſleepes without a Viſion as he calls them, who tells the world of a ſudden return of Monarchy to its old bias, and has been ſo ſaucy to petition our grand Councel to bring home <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to his Engliſh Throne, and threatens their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience with an utter deſtruction; yet this man has not only ſcap'd hitherto with impunity, but they ſay is privately cajold by ſome Starres of magnitude; tis true, his former predictions have been ſtrangely credited with events, as the death
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115124:95"/>of the King, the lifting the Lords <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Fairfax</hi> ſucceſſively to the Generalls place, the downfall of Presbytery, and diſſolution of this Parliament, which he hit to half an houre: but I ſuppoſe you have ſeen moſt of this in his Books: if you have them not, I will ſend you them next week bound in one: for my part I read them for nought but ſport, but he is not half ſo much laugh'd at as he was at firſt. I did intend to put out my Letters next terme, but I ſee I ſhall be hinder'd by a ſudden reſolution my Lord and Lady have lately taken, to make a Journey to the Bath, and ſo from thence into <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to viſit two Siſters of my Lords, which are there richly married.

You do well to ſay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided; for the remoteſt corner of the Earth cannot hide you from me, and even at ſuch times when I know not where you are I viſit you: you have put ſuch ſweetneſs, and yet ſo much gravity in your words, as I know not whether I am more raviſh'd or inſtructed, and have much adoe to ſcape ſelf-love, becauſe I am ſo lov'd, though I do more then like the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of diſpoſitions, obſervation of national propenſions, and proper diſtempers; your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the foot-ſteps, skilful reading upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayd

Had my eyes only betray'd me, and your face and feature ty'd on my chains, I might have truſted time and abſence for a Cure, and read for it in the variety of other cheeks that are white and red; but tis your diviner part has charm'd me, that Soul of vertue and diſcretion that guided your Pen took me priſoner: nor can I hope a releaſe from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince Reaſon it ſelf is a fellow-captive with the reſt.

               <p>YOur laſt undated Letter I received laſt night, and perus'd the well-woven variety in it with ſo clear a delight, as it reſembled the Suns victorious glory in a Cloudy morning, diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115124:101"/>the miſts of melancholy which has lately got a trick to ſit ſomething heavy on my dull ſpirit; but I am reſolv'd to rowſe it: how Sir <hi>J.</hi> has digeſted my miſtake, and the ſtupid effects of it, I know not, nor do I much diſturb my thoughts about it, for he has parted with much of his Candor, if he does not reſent true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, (though ill expreſt.) It is not in my power to overvalue your laſt kindneſs, ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall condeſcenſions in a true Friend being (like the greateſt number in Arithmetick) impoſſible to be expreſt; and had my will a power ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate, you would ſoon ſee the requital would much furmount the acknowledgement. I ſuppoſe my laſt (if it ſcap'd the danger of ſo long a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) told you, that I am now a Patient to one Mr. <hi>D.</hi> whoſe Phyſick I ſtill daily take, (though yet with little apparent ſucceſs;) but he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore I do not deſpair; however if you have a <hi>Recipe</hi> from Dr. <hi>B.</hi> of ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign <hi>lotium,</hi> it will be gratefully welcom. I am invective againſt cruel Intereſt, and do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid my narrow condition that will not ſuffer me to meet you at <hi>Norwich,</hi> (ſo much love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inviter, and would fain be the Gueſt) but my Chain is not long enough to reach ſo farre, and (till opportunity growes ripe) I am loſh to break it: I will therefore content my ſelf to wiſh your meeting happily divided betwixt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and delight.</p>

               <p>I cannot diſapprove the Character of the Gentleman, and not be Cynical; only I could have wiſh'd (for my Siſters ſake) that his mind had not held moſt of his Treaſure; but it ſeemes, affection makes her willing to accept of an <hi>Utopian</hi> Joynture. The joyes are confeſt more purely genuine that wait at thoſe Nuptials where Love makes the match, and not Intereſt; but this age is ſway'd with ſuch a blind injuſtice, that it even forces a by as upon the moſt prudent vertue. Indeed I alwayes obſerv'd in her a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet foreſeeing Providence, while ſhe ſtood at the ſtern of her own Cockboat. In which, (if he does match her as well as in affection) no doubt but the bigger bark of their Family will be well Piloted, and ſo by a joynt Induſtry their ſtock daily increaſed. I do exceedingly applaud the ſolidity of your caution, in making ſure of that ſumme; but if I were able to adviſe better (as I am not) it would be fruitleſs, ſince you know with reſolution all counſel is incompatible. This day I wrote to my Siſter <hi>J.</hi> and incloſed it in one to my Siſter <hi>F.</hi> wherein I do (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much regret) acquaint her with my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate failing in her behalf, though I ſtirred in it with as much dexterity both of minde and body as was poſſible; but the main cauſe of our failing was, that I knew not the opportunity ſoone enough.

               <p>YOur advertiſement of the happy Errour came too late to intercept the abortive iſſue which my Creſt-fallen Muſe miſcarried with: but I was never more glad of being abuſed, and am friends with Fame for the deceit, ſince it is like to coſt me no more then a laughing at. But reports of this nature ſhall henceforth onely play faſt and looſe with my ear (as Juglers do with the eye) and claim no credit till backt by apparent certainty. Your imagination cannot fancy a more grateful heart then mine, made ſo by your laſt courteſie, a trouble which none but ſo perfect a friend as your ſelf would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; and though I know you are none of thoſe that can put their courteſies to uſe, and ſo become kindeſt to themſelves in being kind to others, yet I ſhall never judge my ſelf truly happy till I be able to return yours with intereſt. I would gladly find Doctor <hi>B.</hi> not miſtaken in the ſituation of my malady, and I hope my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will hereafter aſſure me, as now my obſervation begins to perſwade, that there is no flaw in his judgment. I have a ſtrong fancy that I ſhall reap much benefit by thoſe lotions he
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115124:104"/>ſpeaks of, and therefore when you go next to <hi>Norwich</hi> let me intreat you to take a note of the ingredients from his dictates, for I conceive no time of the year unſeaſonable to take that kind of Phyſick. 'Tis poſſible Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s directions, as one well skill'd in ſuch medicinals, may prove available, though I intend not to ſtraggle the breadth of a hair from what Doctor <hi>B.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. We are now retir'd from my Lord of <hi>Lincolns</hi> to a houſe of my Lord of <hi>Clares</hi> in <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinghamſhire,</hi> where a Hermit is not more alone then I, this Countrey affording nothing fit to converſe with but dumb companions, as pleaſing walks in Gardens, Groves, by Rivers, &amp;c. of which it is not unfruitful; that had I <hi>Adams</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and knowledge, my preſent condition would reſemble his before <hi>Eve</hi> was created. I have lately not without much regret loſt my <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tutor, who is parted from my Eady <hi>D.</hi> I am unfeignedly glad to hear of the health of my ſiſters, and that they manage their deſerts with ſo diſcreet a providence to improve reputation. If you find Hymen is like to light an auſpicious torch, and the true-loves knot be worth the tying, I ſhall not give a faint applauſe to the change of my ſiſter <hi>K</hi>'s condition; I ſhall be glad to hear in your next that ſhe draws in a happy yoke; they ſhall have my hearty wiſhes that their ſweet bondage may know no other fetters then what are woven by the ſoft hand of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115124:105"/>vertuous unfading Love: might I hope the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to meet you at <hi>London,</hi> nothing would be able to out-glad me; but I do more than fear that we are to conſume this winter in theſe parts, unleſs a new kindled Warre do ſend us packing, and then I am ſure that unſanctified City muſt prove our Sanctuary: that which makes it too probable is, that my Lord of <hi>C.</hi> is coming down thence with his whole Family, to increaſe ours here. I pray preſent my humble ſervice to my Couſin <hi>H. C.</hi> and tell him, that if I can ſerve him in ought with his Uncle, who lives within five miles of my Lord of <hi>L.</hi> Caſtle, at <hi>T.</hi> (which we ſhall often viſit) he ſhall not find my indeavours tardy; I have not yet ſeen him, but intend at our next going: tis reported there, that the other <hi>H. C.</hi> is grown a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; but if report ſayes true, he is like to plague their expectations with a moſt unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable long life, as if Time had forſworn to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> to whom he yet has denyed the homage of either ſtooping or droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; I intend to ſend him a pot of red Dear, which they ſay will be welcom. I pray preſent my affectionate reſpects to my Siſters, and tell my Siſter <hi>J.</hi> that I am now in chaſe of a place for her, which if obtained will pay for all her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; tis to ſerve the Lady <hi>A. W.</hi> and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ingage no worſe Soliciter then my own Lady her Couſin Jerman; but I am afraid tis
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115124:105"/>promiſed already, and therefore let her not hope too much; only if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, 'twere fit I had notice where a Meſſenger ſhould find her; for I intend to ſend one on purpoſe. But I grow intolerable: pardon this rout of words, and call me as I truly am,</p>

               <p>MY laſt had not been followed at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if the ſudden news of a <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi>-journey had not arreſted my Pen in the very act. My condition ſcatters uncertainty among the broken parcels of my time; and I muſt be no leſs then a Prophet to foretell how I ſhall ſpend the next hour; my firmeſt purpoſes being ſtill curb'd with a conditional bridle. Thus I utter the larger part of my indeavours, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument does ſound, that only talks over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of an imperious hand. Yet I cannot ſay
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115124:107"/>that any new reſtraint does raiſe the price of my leiſure: but the continuance of my trouble, which I now ſuſpect will keep me company to the threſhold of the other World (in ſpite of all the aid of reaſon) does often untune and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe my ſoul, that (though I ſhould bluſh to ſay ſo) it even faints my induſtry, ſlacks my carriere, and makes me halt after ſuch deſigns, which otherwiſe I think I ſhould purſue with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. But I take it as a fatherly correction ſent with commiſſion to ſet me the way to Heaven, and ſo I hope I ſhall uſe it. We are now more then two years older ſince we laſt ſhak'd hands; which (when I look back upon at a lump) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks (in reference to my ſelf) looks as if woven into a Chaos. From ſome I have incountred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts that have ſtrook fire in my breaſt; from other (ſweet ingenious ſpirits) I have been fann'd with a gentle gale of ſerene affection; ſuch humerous waves have flow'd round my Bark, as (at the ſame hour) have mildly kiſt my keel, and ſpit foam at my top-ſayl: and for earth, I am a double debtour to the conſtitution of my body, and my fortunes, that my Chaos has been plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully furniſht with that melancholy element. It cannot poſe your conjecture to conceive how tenderly I would hug an occaſion that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me the delight of ſo dear a ſociety; for (if I deem aright) you may eaſily cut out ſuch an imagination by the pattern of your own heart.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115124:108"/>But if I gain my health, I taſte what others call pleaſure with a feaveriſh palate; I am therefore loth to appear among the friends I love ſo well, till I can bid adieu to a dull humour that now predominates, and my ſoul may have elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room enough (at leaſt) to render my company not tedious. If Providence does intend me ſo dear a Preſent, ſure this ſucceeding Spring muſt bring it, and then I ſhall venture to ask my firſt leave to play, &amp;c. I do much applaud the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the creature made you; I know you have a ſoul that loathes to ſin ſo ſlaviſhly (though tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with fairer hopes then any can court you that way:) tis the badge of a worthy heart that can rather indure to appear leſs, then to be leſs worthy; and tis a rare diſpoſition that will not ſuffer it ſelf to be cheapened in ſuch an age as this. But (though vertue ſometimes ſets a long day) her pay is currant and ſterling, all the reſt falſe coyn.</p>
               <p>My Lady has newly got another ſwelling in the belly, which I believe about five moneths hence will make us hoiſe fail for <hi>London</hi> (for there they apprehend is the ſafeſt unlading for ſuch fraights;) if I may meet you there you will give me more happineſs then I have reliſht ſince I laſt ſaw you: And be confident your perſon and parts will find a more eaſie task in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of preferment, then mine have done (in ſo many reſpects their inferiour;) and if you can

You tell me of two potent enemies you have to ſtruggle with, <hi>viz.</hi> Malice and Envy; indeed they are two of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Waſps that Satan lets fly; but where they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115124:110"/>meet with integrity, (of which I know you are not unfurniſh'd) they may ſeem to ſting, but there riſes no bliſter; and thus their emiſſive ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, like the foreſeen Baſiliske, (which for ought I know may be no more then an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of them) will fatally recoyl upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for the cauſe of it, becauſe you think fit to binde it up in clouds, I will not ſtrive to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap it; onely I ſhall love my own conjectures well, if event applauds them, that it portends you ſome conjugal preferment. I am ſory <hi>C. T.</hi> growes ſo laviſh of his reputation to go in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Warrant, becauſe he does things unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable: I pray God he does not buy wit ſo dear, that he will have nothing left to make any other purchaſe; if I knew how to direct my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I would write to him, but will forbear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, till I grow more able to give good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or at leaſt he more willing to receive it.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115124:111"/>I were happy. I thank you for the hopes you give me of a Cure when I come over, which I believe will now be ſhortly, I am reſolv'd to conſult Dr. <hi>B.</hi> about it; but cuſtom has taught me to fear the worſt.

               <p>I Received yours, and in it much more than was due, by way of acknowledgement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your Son. You are pleaſed to call that a Coutteſie, which was a debt, and indeed not payd at the full; for I muſt ever confeſs, that I owe much more to your preceding Civilities. I find your Sonne indued with all thoſe qualities that may frame him a fair fortune, and a high repute, both by natural and acquiſite parts, which are more than likely to render you a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Father; his apprehenſion is clear and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, his memory ſtrong and retentive, his fancy dexterous and lively, and theſe auſpicious ſignes may well be conſtru'd into hopes of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built Judgement, which is the nobleſt faculty of man. I perceive his induſtry in his ſtudies is elaborate, and his obſervation alwayes ready to cull Honey from every Flower; in ſhort, I think he will no way deceive your expectation, unleſs it be in going beyond it. Sir, I deemed this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count due by obligation from, Sir,</p>

It has pleaſed God to viſit my Lord and Lady, one with a Feaver, the other with a Tertian Ague; but as yet neither expreſſes any violence, and therefore perſwades no fear of danger. The remembrance of your conditional promiſe to give them a Sermon next Sunday made me deem it fit to ſend you this notice, that you might preſerve your performance for a fit time; unleſs you will convert your intentions to the charity of a viſit. I ſhould be glad to hear Mrs. <hi>C.</hi> had ſhaken off her ſhaker. As my promiſe ty'd me, I have ſent her the <hi>Polonian</hi> Story, which perhaps may feather ſome tedious hours; when ſhe has done with that, <hi>C.</hi> is at her ſervice, or at leaſt ſhall be at a Weeks warning.

               <p>THe three Letters you mention I confeſſe I received; and if we had not ſtill been ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, like feathers in the wind, my ſilence would want excuſe, and in plain Engliſh be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated ſloth; for I was forc'd to take an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com Paradox from the hands of Neceſſity, for too much motion ſtayd my hand. Since we loſt the ſight of <hi>London,</hi> I have dated all my Letters not where I dwelt, but where I was; but now I hope we ſhall ſit ſtill and breath a while, ſo my dumb Pen will come to its ſpeech again.</p>
               <p>I am deep in your debt for abundance of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expreſſions, and want words to tell you how tenderly I entertained them; the task is too big to let you ſee how dear you are to me: do me but the Courteſie to fancy an affection, pure, unbiaſſed, unreſerved, that ſcorns limits, loaths change, and is onely leſſe excellent than that which makes the Angels clap their wings, and you have a draught of mine; to deſcribe which in particular were to let an Ocean through a quill. I am ſory you are faſtned to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with Goſſomere-tyings; but though thoſe Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs were Cables, I believe you might find a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115124:113"/>more commodious harbour to let fall your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in. If you think it fit, let your next a little more unmask your ingagements, and ſhew me how your inclinations ſtand, and whether you can draw off upon a ſudden warning. My friend on the other ſide the Sea has not yet accepted imployment, (this Age looks too much aſquint on true deſert,) he ſtill redoubles his kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon me, and ſo far as he is mine he ſhall be yours. I pray if you can learn, let your next tell me how his <hi>Norfolk</hi>-friends do; for he deſires to know. I am not yet likely to draw my neck out of the Collar; but when I do, I ſhall loath to invite yours intoit: without flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, your perſon and parts do deſerve better, and muſt have it. If this wretched malady did not ſtill haunt me, I ſhould not long trifle away my houres in a dull and barren ſervitude. I am now my own Phyſitian and Patient; from my own preſcription I have taken a Vomit, a Purge, a Collution, a Dentifrice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if theſe fail, the hopes of a Cure will ſicken, and I ſhall onely comfort my ſelf in the calamities of a ſhort life with eternity. Sorrow and joy chaſtis'd one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in my breaſt, at the newes of my Siſter <hi>F</hi>'s gentle miſery. I will not wrong your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to give you the reaſons, I hope by this time ſhe is perfectly recovered, and will congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate it ſhortly in a few lines to her. I pray pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me affectionately to my kind Siſter <hi>J.</hi> and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115124:113"/>tell her I was not maſter of ſo much time to write to her this opportunity; for I am forc'd to blot you out theſe words I ſend you in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding haſt. Let me beg your furtherance in my Phyſical Studies: I would gladly intreat permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to tranſcribe your Book; but tis an unfit requeſt to venture it ſo long and dangerous a voyage: onely this let me crave, that in your next I may receive the Copies of three or four of your moſt vertuous diet-drinkes, eſpecially Dr. <hi>Butler</hi>'s; and the receipt of your rare Balſom, with a little quantity of it, if you have any made. I am happy in my Friends welfare, proud of their love, and wiſh I had worth enough to make it appear they have not diſplaced their affection. I will make amends for my laſt long ebbe with a future overflow. Salute all that know me with becoming reſpects proportion'd to them; and now give me leave to cloſe all with ſuch words as I muſt make till death cloſe my eyes: I am</p>

Believe it Sir, I mean it no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in profeſſing my ſelf much in your debt; but you alwayes rang'd your ſelf in that ſmall number of mankind that ſowe their favours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expectation of a crop, and place their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light rather in planting courteſies, then gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fruits.

If my laſt told you I was well, I muſt give this Commiſſion to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I am bound to ſuffer all without repugnance or repining, ſince whenever the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity corrects with the greateſt ſeverity, we ought to take alarums from thoſe ſtripes, not only to give the onſet, but perſevere to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of all that ſtands in our way to eternal felicity. I am very glad to ſee ſo many repeated
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115124:119"/>confirmations of my Siſter <hi>J</hi>'s. happineſs in a Husband; in which my affection goes a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and if my wiſh can get her a Leaſe of it for her life, ſhe ſhall not want it. I ſhould be fearful to ſay any thing to my Siſter <hi>F.</hi> though I were farre more able then I am to adviſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I neither know the man, nor his diſpoſition, how qualified or inclined; but admit them all proportioned to her deſires, for my part I ſhould be hardly drawn to acknowledge it could much mend her condition, which, if I miſtake not, was very happy, if ſhe has but a true taſt to reliſh it: when I return to <hi>London,</hi> which will be about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to do her deſires in reference to her Son; but am now upon the brink of our going into <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi> I am ſo full of buſineſs as I am not maſter of an houres leiſure; and therefore if you find any non-ſenſe here, impute it to the conſtraint of my precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: we muſt ſet out upon <hi>Munday</hi> next. When you write, (which I deſire may be often) direct your Letters to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> the P. in <hi>Ivy-Lane,</hi> and by him they will be infallibly ſent me, and my anſwers returned; in which I promiſe to be conſtant and circumſpect. Well, dear Brother, I have now no time to ſay more; in my next I intend to be more ſpacious in the account of my own Condition, which in relation to thoſe I ſerve does grow Hectical, and unlikely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; and verily, ſhould I ſtay much longer
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115124:119"/>with them, the non-competency of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance would undo me: therefore I intend to look out for ſome other imployment at my next return to <hi>London.</hi> Dear Brother, pardon my abrupt Farewel, and call me your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</p>

This is a better opportunity to tell you, Sir, that your modeſty in expreſſing yours, and the Families worth, turns your artificial Pen into a Pencil, to which, if it were poſſible, your ſhadows would adde excellence. I muſt beg you would take a ruder draught of my heart, which is, that I truly honour you; and what wants in that of art, is made good in reality.

Sir, to you, if I could, I would not clip the wings of my hearty expreſſions with Complement, leſt, like the new-voted-down mony, they ſhould not paſſe for currant. I will ſtill weare the impreſſe your obliging goodneſs has ſtampt upon me, and when I prove falſe coin, let me be puniſht in not being received for, Sir,</p>

               <p>YOu have ſo over-done your acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what a ſilent acceptance had more then requited, as I can do no leſſe then condemn you of a loving error. The eyes of Judgement are never dim'd with ſuch Catarrhes as when affection ſhapes the Object to their Opticks; and, like our dear ſins, hide their uglineſs in the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115124:120"/>maskarade of delight, profit, or whatever elſe is the fitteſt engine to undermine our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If the trifle I ſent you had not been ſpoyled before, your expectation had done it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and, like <hi>Eſops</hi> labouring Mountain, would have brought it to bed of a Mouſe. But I will trace this talk no farther, leſt too modeſt a flight from my friends approvement ſhould give ſuſpicion of an ambuſh to ſurpriſe more, and palpably ſeem to act an Angler, who often draws away the bait, that the Fiſh may follow it the more greedily. I am glad you wear out your Pencils ſo faſt to your own advantage, which, however you ſhadow, your deſerts cannot chuſe but add freſh beauties to your reputation. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to mention your quere about my Lord <hi>W.</hi> in your Couſins Letter, who had buried it ſo long in his pocket before I received it, as it had put on the diſcoloured Livery of time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its Reſurrection, by wearing the duſt of its Grave about it. But to the purpoſe; that Lord is ſo farre from Collonizing, as himſelf is newly tranſplanted from the <hi>Barbados</hi> (where he was Governour) by the Parliament forces, and is now coming home againſt his will, to refix himſelf in his native ſoyl; and this is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, as a Diurnall of two moneths old will tell you the Story. Major <hi>W.</hi> is much your Servant; we ſeldom meet but we ſacrifice a glaſſe to your health; and if there be the thing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115124:121"/>Philoſophers call intelligence of ſpirits, you fare the better for it. By that time you have read mine through his Book will be with you, and come like the ſecond Courſe to a Dinner, which alwayes conſiſts of the moſt delicate fare. I ſend you this by my Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s. man, who looks upon me as if he were ſcarce my Cater-couſin, for you know what; but in ſuch caſes I am partly good at careleſneſs. But I have ſaid too much, unleſs I could have ſaid it better; and tis high time to ſubſcribe my ſelf, Dear Brother,</p>

               <p>IT has not been the leaſt of my diſcontents, that I have been forced to let you want the content your laſt Letter mentions in the receipt of ſome of mine; but this let me intreat, that you will never ſuffer your conjecture to deal ſo unkindly with me, as to impute a literal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a flaw in affection. If you knew how much my ſtrict imployment does inſtruct me to ſay for my ſelf, you would grant I need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a neglect; and if you ſaw how well you are ſeated in my breaſt, your knowledge would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your doubts of my Integrity, and leave them no poſſibility of a new inſurrection. The 100. Epiſtles did not ſpeak all my heart meant you. It is only in viſible effects that my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will indure improvement, in my intentions it cannot; but as it can only that way appear to be more, ſo be confident it ſhall never find any way to be leſſe: but time is now too pretious with me, to inſtruct you further in what you know. I received a brace of loving Letters from my new Brother and his Bedfellow; their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, like themſelves, lay lovingly in a ſheet
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115124:122"/>together, onely in this a little prepoſterous, that he lay undermoſt; indeed the man does offer friendſhip ſo handſomly, that I ſhould ſhew my ſelf ill ſeen in civility not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. I perceive (though you confeſs your ſelf ſubject to the Palſie) your judgement was not level'd at his deſert with an unſteady hand; the Character you have given him, with what he has ſpoke himſelf, hath help'd me to a longing to be known his Friend as well as his Brother: but this will ask time, and perhaps more merit then I am maſter of. I am glad you do not yet let go your hold where you are; and though the wide miſſe of ſome former aymes may diſcredit my judgement, yet he that has but a twilight of Reaſon may perceive the Cloud not farre off that is like to make us more foul weather; (and while the Tempeſt laſts) ſafe ſhelters are precious. If you knew how glad your Letters make me, and were leſſe guilty of that rare fault of undervaluing your own Commodities, you would ſee leſſe cauſe to confeſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change gainful: but (as truth ingages me) I muſt needs commend the beauty that breaks out into your literal expreſſions with a daily increaſe of luſtre. I find you have thriving thoughts, (and though in men it alwayes holds not) yet ſure in thoſe the height of the quality may be taken from the handſomneſs of the veſture: if you go on thus, your Pen will plant Rhetorical Flowers,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115124:123"/>as skilfully as your Pencil paints others; and this word Paint leads me to lay hold of half a promiſe which your laſt makes to ſend me the <hi>K</hi>'s face in a Letter: let me firſt acknowledge ſome eager deſires of my own to poſſeſs it, and then inform you that I have a deſign to let ſome great ones ſee what you are able to do, and ſo make you known to them before they know you. I will ſhortly tell my Siſter <hi>F.</hi> how glad I am of her recovery: preſent me dearly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>J.</hi> and I pray take ſome occaſion to let my Aunt <hi>H.</hi> know that I do paſſionately deſire ſo to ſerve her as may ſpeak her good opinion not miſplac'd. I am now about to ſtruggle har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt with my malady, but I am almoſt forbidden to hope a perfect Cure by a rational Phyſitian in theſe parts; but I hope I ſhall obtain ſo much power over my ſelf, as to reſign my wiſhes and will to his that is the Fountain of power. I ſnatch this time of writing this from ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that would hardly permit it: therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute theſe blotted faults to that mother of ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, call'd Haſte.

               <p>THough my ſilence ſince the receipt of yours may have done me ſome ill offices in your opinion, yet you may ſafely believe without incurring the danger of an error, that coldneſs of affection had no hand in the ſeeming ſloth of my Pen: the truth is, I had a double perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſtay my hand, as well to wait this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Lady <hi>P.</hi> going down, that I might promiſe my ſelf ſome ſecurity of delivering mine into your hands, as returning an account of thoſe endeavours you hinted in yours, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the removal of that unkind Law-quarrel betwixt your Siſter and Father in Law, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated peace: really, dear Couſin, I am ſory to find my ſelf in no capacity to experiment my affection to both the parties, by rendring my ſelf an inſtrument of ſo happy a Compremiſe and accord, nor is it want of will or wiſhes that I am not ſo; but after ſome attempts that way, I find your Siſter has ſo intirely reſigned that buſineſs to the conduct and management of a diſcreet perſon, that has now (as he tells her) driven it very neer a happy period, as ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſafely let fall, or ſuſpend her legal proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115124:124"/>without running the danger of loſing ſo powerful an aſſiſtant; and therefore I could wiſh that you, and the reſt that cannot look upon her actions at this diſtance but through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of anothers report, would not uſe her too ſeverely in your thoughts, till the laſt ſcene be acted; for I am confident ſhe has ſo fair a ſtock of piety and diſcretion, as will take off the imputation of diſobedience to her good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and unkindneſs to your ſelf, and the reſt of her friends. But I have touched that ſtring too much, unleſs I were able to ſpeak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with more ſatisfaction.

Since affection help'd you to reliſh the firſt ſo well, I have ſent you the ſecond part of <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> for which you will pay too much if you take the pains to read it; but, dear Couſin, accept it from him that will ever be ſtudious to ſtart bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſions to appear what I am and ever will be,</p>

My ſimplicity ſuffer'd me a long time to be cheated with that general error that gulls the whole heard of vulgar underſtandings; I weighed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in the common ballance, my Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took the print of things from my outward ſenſes, and I judg'd the conſtitution of affaires by their falſe complexion: But at length, perceiving how wide I ſhot at events, and what amazing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115124:126"/>ſtarted from unobſerv'd cauſes, I found not only my inconſiderable ſelf, but many that made a brighter ſhow, and a greater noiſe in the World with their quality and parts, had been catcht in the ſame nooze, and were ſtill liable to the ſame abuſe at laſt. I reſolved to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I could learn to ſee without that Glaſſe that had ſo often falſifi'd the Object; at length, by the illuſtration of ſome clear Judgements, (whoſe acquaintance I won by inches) I arrived at this glimmering:</p>
               <p>There is a certain ſort of active men, grown main actors upon one Stage, that onely appear in their perfect ſhape to one another, to the World a homely outſide hides an out-landiſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Their Education has ſtor'd them with Principles of excellent Learning, a Taper they alwayes keep in a dark Lanthorn, and either ſhew or hide it, as the ſeaſon of opportunity, the nature of affaires, and the inclination of Perſons with whom they treat do either prompt or prohibit. They are the moſt exact Students of men, the nimbleſt divers into diſpoſitions, the happieſt in inſinuation, and the cunningeſt in compliance with all humours under Heaven. In fine, they appear to every inclination in the ſame ſhape the predominant humour delights in; and with a provident policy and dexterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, not onely make the vertues, but even the vices of their active acquaintance ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115124:127"/>to their main deſign: no doubt they were furniſht with better reaſons than you are like to have of me why they wav'd the Kings party, and adher'd to this; ſuch as the ſhort arms of my conjecture could fathom are theſe: Firſt, they knew a Parliament ſo univerſally deſir'd as this could not chuſe but be ſtrong in popular reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially having indear'd it ſelf to them by that excellent beginning of removing unjuſt preſſures from the ſhoulders of the ſuffering ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by finding out abuſes, and abuſers of the Government, and by promiſing that ſame coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word of Reformation both in Church and State. Secondly, They knew they could hope for no Harveſt of their endeavours, till they had ſown pleaſing and plauſible inſinuations in the eares of the inferior rank: the Royaliſts they knew were no fit Soyl to entertain this ſeed; they of the lower Region being incapable of, and repugnant to any apprehenſion that at firſt gaze did not appear a viſible aid to the cauſe that unſheath'd their Swords; beſides their too free and open hearts, their careleſs and (indeed) diſſolute carriage, rendered them unfit to be truſted with any notion that demanded ſilence; and on thoſe of eminent degree they had as little hope to faſten their deſigns, for beſides that they hated any thing that but ſmelt of their beſt bait Innovation, they wanted unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (the main Pillar that ſhould prop ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings)
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115124:127"/>for the ſtudy of advancing peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, feeding the inſatiate appetite of private ambition, indiſcreet competition for priority, quarrels, and hunting profit and pleaſure with too hot a ſent, were the ſad cauſes of that unfortunate parties undoing, and the reaſons why theſe ſubtile Engeneers found them unfit inſtruments to advantage their obſtruſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Thirdly, On the other ſide, they met with materials aptly diſpoſed to take that Impreſſe they thought fit cunningly to leave upon the ſoft wax of their tender conſciences; they were furniſh'd with ready Mathematicks, to take the height and latitude of theſe ſpirits, which were as fit to carry on their deſign, as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſcontent with the Government that was uppermoſt, a vehement deſire of Innovation, the repair of ruinous fortunes, and the loud fame of a glorious victory (inſcribed with Religion and liberty) could make them. Fourthly, They had the inexhauſtible Treaſure of the Kingdom at command, which they could renew at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the indiſpenſible edict of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: with this unreſiſtible Engine they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their enemies fidelity, bargain'd for their ſtrong holds, and even bought thoſe victories that have coſt the World ſo much aſtoniſhment; nothing being ſo injurious to the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial rights as his own Pictures.</p>

For theſe petty ſervices, I would not have you diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our friendſhip ſo much as to name them: tis fit we ſhould reſign ſuch Ceremonies to thoſe cold-hearted Creatures that love to ſell their kindneſſes, and have a ballance to weigh before they deliver them. Nor let the flame of our amity be of an ethereal nature, alwayes true
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115124:129"/>to an equality of heat and meaſure. Methinks the Poets ſhould have meant ſuch a fire as this for that which <hi>Promotheus</hi> ſtole from Heaven; and they that have vertue enough to ſtay it from evaporation may carry it thither again; while the other is kept alive with the courſe fuell of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and as that flowes or ebbs, ſo does it blaze or languiſh, till at laſt it ſwounds away in a ſocket. But I have talkt ſo much upon this ſubject, and ſo often, that I doubt my repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may purchaſe me the account of a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And now to ſprinkle a little news; on Saturday laſt the fortunate and victorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> invited with as much Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical importunity as the high opinion of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and valour, joyn'd with the ſuſpition of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing dangers could indite, was conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>London</hi> with a ſpecious ſolemnity, and there had a loud welcome roar'd him by the comfort of Guns, Drums, and Voices; from the City he received a Preſent of about 2000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> value, delivered with abundance of creeping thanks for his faithful gallantry. On Munday following, with a numerous train of creatures and admirers, he enter'd the Houſe of Commons, where the Speaker welcom'd him with a ſpeech that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the thanks of the Houſe, imbroider'd with lofty Praiſes, a rehearſal of his moſt ſignal ſervices done both here and beyond the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, mingled with the relation of his Pedigree;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115124:130"/>whereto he added, how much his Diſcretion, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Religion, Policy and Fortitude, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled the ſleeping aſhes of his famous ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and clos'd with the cauſe of his invitation, told him that he had no ſooner nam'd what he had already done, but by the univerſal deſire of the Houſe he was to proffer him occaſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his own merit with their gratitude; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that he had received Letters from their <hi>Low-Countrey</hi>-Agent that aſſured him of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain agreement 'twixt the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> and his ſubjects; that there was nothing wanting but a wind to waft him thither, and in all probability being once ſeated there, he would not long ſit ſtil contented w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> that Crown; and concluded w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the choice the Houſe had made of him to command their Army Northward: who return'd his high reſentment of their favours in a ſhort modeſt ſpeech, wherein he ſtrived to extenuate his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to expreſs his reſolutions to ſpend his deareſt bloud in the ſervice of his Countrey.

               <p>I Am well ſatisfied concerning your love, by your laſt miſſive, which withall brought me the acceptable account of your health and beſt proſperity. Whether this will find you out or no, is very uncertain; yet, to exerciſe my affection, and to quiet my heart, I took up a reſolution to write, though the Letter periſh in the midſt of the Alpes. That long intercourſe this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us hath begotten in me both fears and hopes; which yet are not liable to exception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they flow from that limpid ſpring which was never mudded with ſelf-intereſt. I priz'd you for your vertues, and that ſympathetical temper which I diſcerned in you, beyond which I had no eye; and yet I am ſecure in all my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. But what doth my friend in thoſe remoter Countreys thus long? why muſt <hi>Belgia</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have ſo much of you, and <hi>England</hi> ſo little? what curioſities do you ſearch for? what actions do you deſign? and what improvements do you attend? I will not believe you like him in the Poet, <hi>Securus quò pes ferat—</hi> and that you do <hi>ex tempore vivere.</hi> I have heard that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath been defin'd—<hi>Ens Oviſmatum;</hi> but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115124:131"/>this is not applicable to a wiſe man, who paceth the World with judgment, and asks upon every remove — <hi>Cui bono</hi> — Not that I deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into your Cabinet at this diſtance, for I know you are arriv'd at that of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier — <hi>Gli penſieri stretti &amp; il viſo ſuotto.</hi> You can Engliſh it better then I; notwithſtanding I wiſh my ſelf ſometimes better acquainted with the project, that I may ſerve you better.

Will you credit me? this I deem a witty ſuggeſtion of an enemy, which I can anſwer without you; yet to raze this to the foundation, I call for your help. It cannot be that we ſhould vary here, when in thoſe higheſt concernments we have been always one — <hi>Et quoad rem, &amp; quoad modum;</hi> but enough of this. Your friends are yet alive both here and elſewhere; but the Orb of Learning has loſt of late ſtars of the firſt magnitude, Dr. <hi>Collins</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cumber;</hi> the former had his Apotheoſis a year ſince, the later is commemorated this day. Thus things and perſons die, but the Lord abideth for ever; to him let us direct our thoughts and ſervices, and by his revealed truth alone let us meaſure our beſt way to eternity — which you pray that I may find.

Since thus, though debarr'd of a perſonal interview, our nobler parts that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence our immortality, meet, converſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the dear entertainment of mutual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. I am beholding to your loving errour as well as the World's, for ſetting my toy at ſo high a rate: But now for the hard words you ſpeak of, I know they have made work for ſome of thoſe <hi>Cato's</hi> of Language this Age has hatcht, which came with a like intent to the peruſal of books, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did to view the Army of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> on purpoſe to give them ill language; and I would fain know of thoſe Cenſors, if prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages, by a like deſign, had not providently inoculated ſome of the faireſt Cions of forraign

The word Raillery you return'd me for interpretation, ſignifies a kind of jeſting, ſcoffing diſſimulation, and is now grown here ſo common with the better ſort, as there are few of the meaner that are not able to conſtrue it; which makes me wonder by what miſchance it ſhould ſcape the knowledge of that living Library of Languages Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to whom I pray return my ſervice; but he muſt allow me the Liberty to think he knows too little of the <hi>French</hi> to rank it juſtly with the reſt of his Languages: but enough of that. And I now eagerly wiſh your propoſal were improv'd to a reſolution of ſeeing <hi>London</hi> next Term, ſince I am more then half aſſur'd we ſhall not turn our backs upon it till that be expired, and then whether we ſhall ſteer our courſe Weſt-ward or North-ward, is not yet concluded in the thoughts of thoſe that ſit at the helm. But I am ſorry I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wind you up to any forward expectation
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115124:132"/>in what refers to my Lord <hi>R.</hi> for I daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fruits of my indeavours that way do rather wither then ripen; and I am glad you are ſtruck in with ſo friendly a man mender.

               <p>THough ſince my Pen laſt ſaluted you there has not paſt a day wherein you have not found work for my memory, and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in my well-wiſhes, yet leſt you ſhould give ſilence the name of neglect (an error fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with tender affections.) I am content to think it buſineſs enough for a Letter to repeat what I have ſo often made the onely buſineſs of my Pen, and tell you that I truly love you: this from a ſtranger perhaps would ask more than a ſingle proof to be believed not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, but from a Brother that has ſo often ſhewed you his heart I know you cannot ſin ſo much as to doubt it; and let me ſay this, to the commendation of our honeſt-hearted Family,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115124:134"/>that though we are below others in the rich gifts of Fortune and Nature, yet for perfect inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, unmixt with what they call politick ends, and ſincere ſpotleſs affection one to another, we are not exceld by any that ever yet my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation medled with; and ſince it traded with variety of humours and diſpoſitions, it has not been altogether pur-blind. If there needed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to keep this affectionate temper from a cold decay, I would ſtrain hard for ſuch as ſhould reſtore us the beauty of this lovely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inclination; but I know there is little want of ſuch reſtoratives in you, and I borrow a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from experience that bids me ſay as much for all the reſt: well then, let us ſtill che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh this mutual affection that makes our ſouls as neer akin as our bodies; for by loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tis the way to purchaſe his favour who is Love it ſelf. If there were any alteration in my condition ſince you received my laſt Letter, I ſhould be ready to let you know it, as one that has no little Intereſt in me; but while I am here, my endeavors do but labour like a mil-horſe, ſtill repeating their ſteps in a circle, alwayes going round, but not a foot forward in the path of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. I am now once more in a courſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick for my malady, and in hope it will ſtruggle ſucceſsfully with it: but I am like to buy theſe deſires ſo dear, that to recover my health will ſicken my purſe; but of the two, tis a Diſeaſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115124:135"/>leſſe grievous. I pray preſent my much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate ſervice to my excellent Aunt <hi>H.</hi> her good Mother, with the reſt of the Family: ſalute the reſt of my Friends with love or ſervice, as they are due; and to your ſelf, Dear Siſter, take the heart of</p>

               <p>I Have long forborn to write, out of an hopeful expectation to find thee ſuch newes as might claim a juſt welcom; but now I am forc'd to ſay, that my failing in thy behalf is added to the reſt of my own misfortunes. I ſuppoſe my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquainted thee with my hopes to prefer thee to the Lady <hi>A. W.</hi> a Lady in whoſe praiſe I will be ſilent, leſt I ſhould too much vex thee with the miſſe of ſo much happineſs; and it was a narrow miſſe, for I procur'd a Letter from my Lady to her in thy commendations ſo ſoon as I heard her Gentlewoman was to part from her; upon which the motion was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd willingly, only (ſhe replyed) that ſhe had intreated her Aunt the Lady <hi>W.</hi> then at <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:115124:135"/>to procure her one there, but ſhe would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately write her word that ſhe was provided; which ſhe had no ſooner done, but ſhe received newes that her Aunt had already agreed with a Gentlewoman, which was then coming down, and in honour could not be refuſed. Thus have my unfortunate endeavours born thee no other fruit than falſe hopes indeed; this failing does the more afflict me, becauſe I know the value of what is miſt; though we ſhould beſides have liv'd moſt of this Winter together in a houſe, a thing ſo paſſionately deſir'd of us both: but we muſt not repine too much at croſſe events, leſt in it we upbraid Providence; the younger Siſter does yet take none, but when ſhe does thou art ſure to have it. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd moſt hopes to effect thy deſires, is now out of the Kingdom; beſides, our reſiding in this barren Country will much diſable my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in thy behalf. I ſhall conclude with ſuch advice as I believe thy diſcreet goodneſs does daily practiſe, be ſtill the ſame thou ever wert, of a ſweet vertuous winning carriage, ready to pleaſure all, loth to offend any, and thou wilt ingage even Incivility it ſelf to uſe thee civilly, and Inconſtancy to love thee conſtantly: keep ſtill the complexion of Lillies in thy innocence, and of Roſes in thy modeſty; for if once ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd, the water is hardly purchas'd that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore its whiteneſs: thy diſpoſition was alwayes
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115124:136"/>intimate with vertue; endeavour daily to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the amity, and truſt Heaven with the reſt, whoſe bleſſings, though they be long a coming, will richly pay thy patience: loſe not a grain of that pleaſant temper which makes thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſo much courted; for there is nothing ſo happy here, as thoſe calm ſouls that can make unforc'd ſmiles ſhine through a harmleſs jollity. But thou art born to too rich a goodneſs to need the charity of my weak advice: but give me my Preſent back again, and I will take it kindly; and be ſure you love me truly, or elſe you will die much in the debt of</p>

But upon better thoughts, I could be angry with my ſelf for ſuffering ſuch words to get looſe from my Pen, and could willingly puniſh them with a great blot, if I had time to write new ones; for I am confident you do match me too well with the ſame materials to doubt its purity, and we never wonder at any thing that we can pattern in our ſelves: your flint is a true Embleme of perfect friendſhip, which in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom carries fire ready to ſtart forth at the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of occaſion: how ſoon I would obey ſuch an alarum to ſerve you, I hope you will finde prov'd in my future endeavours; but I have not skill enough to add beauty to that which never had a blemiſh. My old Cough, with a great cold to boot, do conſtrain me at this time to be bad Company, which you may eaſily perceive by the languor of my ſtile: this Cough I find has lately fed upon my fleſh, &amp; carried away enough from the poor ſtore I had to make me doubt a Conſumption; but whatſoever the hand of Heaven ſends me I ſhall endeavour to bid wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. I pray let us not fail in our intercourſe while we are ſo neer. My preſent indiſpoſition, with ſome haſt beſide, will let me ſay no more, but that I am and ever will be,</p>

               <p>I Acknowledge the receipt of yours, with a Diurnal, Proverbs, and Tobacco, beſides many other preceding civilities and courteſies; which believe it have rendred me perfectly yours. You may ſafely take my word, this is really meant and will be as cordially confirm'd when any occaſion ſhall becken me to it. We are arrivd at our Countrey habitation, where, in a double ſenſe we may be ſaid to be out of the lines of communication: we dwell at large, and people it, as our forefathers colloniz'd the World in its Nonage; Melancholy, that they wanted partners in their vaſt poſſeſſions: and thus like the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we are come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, only we have the fleſh-pots ſtill, and therefore none of the Manna. This Countrey is ſo barren of good company, though fruitful of all things elſe, that even tir'd out with ſolitude I am forc'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make ſhift with the Parſon of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and he more then half a Presbyterian, you will ſay that's a hard caſe for one that has been us'd to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s company. But I confeſs theſe defects are not ill ſuppli'd by my dumb ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115124:142"/>Beſides Books, we have good Horſes, handſome Walks, pleaſing Groves, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent variety of objects, and they Idaea's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make Fancy a good companion, and Thoughts my recreation. By the help of them I oft remove <hi>London</hi> into the Countrey, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the friends I left behind as well as fancy can preſent them, in the formoſt rank of which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is plac't. Pray render me very kindly to Captain <hi>Wh.</hi> and tell him when I ſee the Major, I ſhall not forget to ſpeak his deſires.

               <p>I Muſt not give you cauſe to ſuſpect I can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you by the neglect of ſo fair an oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to kiſs your hands with a Letter; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I had rather (if there were no Remora) have taken my Pens employment upon my ſelf: how oft have I wiſht for a Mercurial <hi>Caducaeus</hi> to inſomniate the <hi>Argus</hi>-eyes of jealous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that I might ſafely ſteal a viſit, &amp; with it the enjoyment of your happy ſociety? till when I ſhall account my ſelf but a ſlave to that piece of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I now am Maſter of, ſince its narrow limits ſhut out a large ſhare of my highly-valued hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The malice of the times extends beyond the ſuſpenſation of eſtates, to the ſeparation of friends, yet they cannot be truly ſaid to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whoſe free-born ſouls (not inſlav'd to the bodies reſtraint) can hold a mutual commerce and an intelligential converſe one with another; nor can I ſo much diſtruſt Providence, as to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this corporal ſequeſtration can prove an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter privation. My deceiving fancy ſometimes in a ſlumber ſtrives to make me believe I am at <hi>L.</hi> yet in the dream it ſelf I ſuſpect it is but a dream. I could wiſh, methinks, that <hi>Plato</hi>'s year were no fiction, ſo the revolution might be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and we again happily reviſe and live in the Sunſhine of our former Halcion dayes, <hi>Sed jam deſerunt ut omnia Mortalium aſſolent.</hi> —</p>

               <p>I cannot dart my thoughts ſo eagerly upon other things as to loſe a reſtraining power of calling them home to the memory of my friends, and they are beſt imploy'd in abſence when they help to draw themſelves in white and black. I am not of that Philoſophers opinion who affirm'd <hi>Silena</hi> could not hurt, for too much is a diſeaſe in love, and helps to intomb friendſhip in the dark Grove of Oblivion, when the dumb Language of a Pen can, like the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, remove it from its own aſhes, and keep it ſtrong and healthful, &amp;c.—</p>
               <p>By the World thoſe are accounted the onely Cowards, which dare not do that which is ill; which concludes no ſuch ſoleciſm in policy, as the intire friendſhip twixt tongue and heart. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty is grown ridiculous, Integrity ſcofft at, and amity it ſelf never found ſo few friends. Thoſe intentions are contemptibly thought mean, and ſhallow; with whoſe vertuous rectitude, <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous</hi> falſhood is inconſiſtent; the Worlds erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Eſtimation has married Vertue to Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtice to Self-injury, Religion to a Scarcrow, Honeſty to Self-deceit, Faith to Folly, for the execution of particular ends, Vice filtches Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues apparel, though her want of skill in wearing them often diſcovers her impoſturous deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whil'ſt thus Reaſons eye is put out, or at leaſt blinded; the ſouls mortality forgotten, and the Almighty rejected, and eternity diſreſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <p>I Lately received your laſt of the ſixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> for though our Letters glide nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly when they are once aboard, yet they do but crawl by land, and contrary to natural violent motions, do make leaſt haſte when they are neereſt their journeys end, and I have nothing to ſay to your overprizing my barren indeavours in your behalf, and undervaling your own, but onely to entreat you to call to your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the true definition of perfect amity, and that will tell you I am the indebted perſon, and the occaſions you have given me to ſerve.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115124:145"/>You have inſtructed me to ſet ſo many ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my own happineſs. But now, my dear friend, I would I could find it fit to leave the reſt out, and if I had not cauſe to love you for diſcretion as well as goodneſs, I confeſs I ſhould leave you to know this accident from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quill; but I know you are skilful in all the dictates of wiſdom, and can ballance mortal accidents without oppreſſing the ſcale with too much paſſion: this gives me more confidence to tell you I received a late Letter from my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom I engaged to ſend me an account of your friends, which tells me that your father fell ſick upon the ſixteenth of <hi>September</hi> of a Flux, and left the World the tenth of <hi>October;</hi> and now I conjure you by all thoſe clear proofs of your prudent temper, and (to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for my own ends as well as yours) by my intereſt in you, to preſerve us both from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of an over-ſad reſentment: you have all the reaſon that I can urge, and much more, why you ſhould not abandon your ſelf to an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſorrow, and therefore I will throw no more drops into your Ocean, only this, do not chew the Pill that will work better if you ſwallow it, &amp;c. Your Siſter ſeem'd much to bewail your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at ſuch a time, and deſir'd my Brother, who preſents his affectionate ſervice to you, to uſe ſome means to let you know this, and entreat you would entertain no prejudicial conceit of

Let me intreat you to anſwer this as ſoon as you can, and tell me what I may do further to ſerve you: if you love your ſelf and me, let not ſadneſs ſhrink your ſpirits, but let us reſerve our ſelves for that ſame happy meeting you ſpeak of. I confeſs I do more than ſuſpect a Conſumption, and if that be deſigned to fetch me from this World, I think I ſhall go without reluctancy; for I have already received enough of the Divine hand to make me admire his bounty: but I have fair hopes of a recovery.

               <p>I Think Providence has given a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Fortune than formerly; for I confeſs I was nipt with the ſame Paſſion you complain of, <hi>viz.</hi> the unkindneſs of Oblivion: now I ſee 'twas caus'd by the ſtragling of our Letters; mine were ſent by <hi>W.</hi> out of <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and becauſe they promiſed a faithful care in their deliverance, I thought it a better way for expedition, than to ſend them about by <hi>London;</hi> but it ſeemes Haſte brought forth her blind child Error. Yours, after my expectations had loſt many longings (as if they had ſtayed for one anothers company) came almoſt all together; and that's my Landlords fault, for which I ſhall ſchool him: but we have as little cauſe to lay the injuries of Chance to one anothers charge, as to quarrel with a River, becauſe ſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Dam forbids the freedom of its courſe. If there be a poſſibility to raiſe ſuch pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt deſires from our ſouls, as will not be dawb'd with the clay they are confin'd to, I have ſuch to ask and claim your Friendſhip; and thus in ſpite of all our Leaden frailty, we may take a taſte of Heaven, and reliſh the joyes we cry up
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115124:146"/>with ſuch impotent expreſſions in that one word <hi>perfect amity.</hi> I do now begin to be ſo unweildy to my ſelf, and I doubt ſo troubleſom to others, (though they expreſs not ſo much) that I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row reaſons from my Capitall infirmities, to excuſe thoſe you may account the Diſeaſe of my mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if this trouble be deſign'd to fetch me from this World, I think I ſhall go without reluctancy. I am ſtill here (in relation to my dependency) like an unskilful Paſſenger at Sea, that knowes not how long to promiſe himſelf a calm, nor when to expect a ſtorm. If I may vant to have pleas'd in any thing, 'tis my fidelity, which amounts to no more than You have done as becomes you. I am glad I was not born to ſtand at the Sterne of an ample fortune, (to favour my ſelf the beſt I can) I ſhould have abus'd the Divine bounty, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd it chiefly in paying dearer for my ſins than I have done. I have receiv'd enough to make me admire the goodneſs of him that gave it me; and indeed, did not his grace help me to contrary thoughts, 'twere enough to make me an unequal Arbiter of mine own imperfections: to act ſuch conceptions as theſe, is a buſineſs to which we ſhould ſacrifice no cold endeavours, &amp; we live to no purpoſe, unleſs in this life we learn to bid it adieu handſomly. Doing well is the only requiſite mark of mans Induſtry; and he that aimes at any other miſtakes that for a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115124:147"/>white which is but a ſpot: there are ſo many examples of ſuch as angle here for happineſs (and ſometimes with ruine to boot) as methinks to obſerve, ſhould be enough to take heed how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mount Fortunes ladder, and break the ſtaves as they go up, ſo as they have no way to come down but by a Precipice; many ſhoot wide, and perhaps hit moſt happineſs by miſſing what they fancied for it. I could mention more miſtakers: but to cloſe it, there is no man ſtudies the other life better than he that ſtudies this enough to deſpiſe it. It is not my deſire to be underſtood skilful in this Science; for I am bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelf ſubject to moſt wicked reluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and there paſſe few houres that are not witneſſes not only to ſtumblings, but groſſe falls from my beſt reſolutions: but I want your pardon. I thank you for the account of my Friends, which I deſire you would renew, as you are hinted by any extraordinary accidents.
